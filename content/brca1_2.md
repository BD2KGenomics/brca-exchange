# What are BRCA1 and BRCA2?

BRCA1 and BRCA2, referred to collectively as BRCA genes, are genes that encode tumor suppressor proteins. Normally, these 
proteins guard against cancer by helping to detect and repair damaged DNA. However, sequence variation in the BRCA genes 
themselves can lead to altered proteins that do not perform these functions properly. When this occurs, it leads to a 
defective DNA damage response. This results in the DNA sequence acquiring a greater number of variants over time.  
 
In 1994 and 1995, scientists discovered that sequence variants in the BRCA genes can lead to increased risk of breast cancer. 
Since then, certain variants in the BRCA genes have also been linked to increased risk of ovarian cancer, and other diseases. 
However, not every BRCA variant increases an individual’s disease risk.  Some variants are inconsequential, and people with 
such variants show no increased risk of disease. 

The BRCA genes vary between different individuals.  Scientists have been studying genetic variation, which is the aggregation 
of specific differences between individuals, and assessing how individual variants affect each person’s risk of disease. 
Variants can be classified as benign (not leading to increased risk of disease), pathogenic (leading to increased risk of 
disease), or of uncertain significance (requiring further study).  Genetic testing is performed to determine whether an 
individual harbors any known BRCA genetic variants, and if any of these variants increase his or her risk of disease.
