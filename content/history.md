# History of the BRCA Exchange  

Genetic sequencing labs, academic centers, and companies have begun to aggregate observed BRCA1/2 variants in databases 
and to classify them as pathogenic or benign using clinical information and/or other variant evidence. However, there has not been full exchange of all BRCA1/2 data among laboratories, thus stymieing the progress that can be made to classify variants if all variant data, evidence, and classifications were aggregated.

In March 2014, Professor Sir John Burn of Newcastle University, UK proposed a data sharing experiment now called the BRCA Challenge at the first plenary meeting of the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](http://genomicsandhealth.org/) (GA4GH), to address these issues. Over the subsequent months, John Burn and co-chair Stephen Chanock of the National Cancer Institute, USA, formed a Steering Committee including leaders from the breast cancer field and from genomic data sharing efforts. The Steering Committee defined initial goals for the Challenge including:

1. Share BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants publically

2. Create an environment for collaborative variant curation with access to evidence (e.g. phenotypes, family history, genetic data, and functional studies)

3. Create a curated list of BRCA variants, interpreted by expert consensus, to enable, without dictating, accurate clinical care

4. Address the social, ethical, and legal challenges to global data sharing

In collaboration with the Human Variome Project, on June 12-13, 2015, a meeting to further develop the vision for data sharing and expert BRCA variant classification took place at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, including representatives from many laboratories and organizations including Ambry Genetics, AstraZeneca, Annai Systems, ClinGen, ClinVar, Curoverse, DECIPHER, DNAnexus, ENIGMA, Genetic Alliance, Genomics England, Illumina, Inserm, Invitae, LabCorp, LOVD, New England Journal of Medicine, Quest, SolveBio, World Health Organization and many others.

At this meeting, the vision of a web portal to share expert-reviewed BRCA variant classifications was proposed. Since this time, working groups with members located around the world have worked to identify 1) sources of classified variants to be aggregated and 2) unclassified variants with evidence, which can then be interpreted, classified, and aggregated. The classified variants are then displayed at a public portal, the BRCA Exchange, for use by clinicians, patients, and labs to enable accurate understanding of any individual BRCA1/2 variant, for superior clinical care and decision-making.
