# History of the BRCA Exchange  

Genetic sequencing labs, academic centers, and companies have begun to aggregate observed BRCA1/2 variants in databases 
and to classify them as pathogenic or benign using clinical information and/or other variant evidence. However, for regulatory, 
social, cultural, and technical reasons, it is generally not possible for databases to share the classification data with one 
another, thus stymieing the progress that could be made to classify variants if all variant data, evidence, and classifications 
were aggregated.

In March 2014, Professor Sir John Burn of Newcastle University, UK, and Dr. Stephen Chanock of the National Cancer Institute, 
USA, proposed a data sharing experiment called the BRCA Challenge at the first plenary meeting of the [Global Alliance for 
Genomics and Health](http://genomicsandhealth.org/) (GA4GH), to address these issues. Several months later, in collaboration 
with the Human Variome Project, ENIGMA, CIMBA, and UNESCO, leaders in the breast cancer field defined initial goals for the 
Challenge, work which was then incubated in the GA4GHâ€™s Clinical Working Group until early 2015. Then on June 12-13, 2015, 
a meeting to further develop the vision for a global tool to enable BRCA variant classification took place at UNESCO 
headquarters in Paris, with the original participants as well as representatives from the World Health Organization, Ambry 
Genetics, AstraZeneca, Annai Systems, DECIPHER, Inserm, the Genetic Alliance, LabCorp, DNAnexus, Invitae, the New England 
Journal of Medicine, Illumina, Genomics England, SolveBio, Curoverse, and others. 

At this meeting, the vision of a web portal to exchange BRCA variant classifications was introduced. Since this time, 
working groups with members located around the world have worked to identify 1) sources of classified variants to be 
aggregated and 2) unclassified variants with evidence, which can then be interpreted, classified, and aggregated. The 
classified variants are then displayed at a public portal, the BRCA Exchange, for use by clinicians, patients, and labs 
to enable accurate understanding of any individual BRCA1/2 variant, for superior clinical care and decision-making.
