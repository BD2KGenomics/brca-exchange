The BRCA Exchange of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health advances our understanding of the genetic basis of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other diseases by pooling data on BRCA1/2 genetic variants and corresponding clinical data from around the world. This enables a more complete understanding of genetic variation in these genes, which in turn has the potential to improve clinical care and quality of life for women and men who have BRCA1/2 variants identified in their genetic sequences.
