# About this site

This site provides information on catalogued variants for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  By default, it shows variants that have been curated by the [ENIGMA](http://enigmaconsortium.org/) consortium.  These are genetic variants that have been reviewed by experts, to assess their *pathogenecity* (or associated disease risk).  Optional settings allow the user to look at additional variants.  In most cases, these variants are awaiting expert review, and their pathogenecity has not yet been established.

The BRCA Exchange website was developed by the [BRCA Challenge](https://genomicsandhealth.org/work-products-demonstration-projects/brca-challenge-0) consortium of the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](https://genomicsandhealth.org/).  The web site and underlying database were developed by the Computational Genomics Lab at the [UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute](https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/)
