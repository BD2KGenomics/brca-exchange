# BRCA Variation and Cancer

The human BRCA genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, help prevent cancer by producing proteins that detect and repair DNA damage.  When
either of these genes are altered, the alteration can result in proteins that are less effective at detecting or fixing damaged
DNA.  This can leave the individual at greater risk of diseases, especially breast and ovarian cancer.  However, not all
variation in the BRCA genes increases disease risk.  Some variation is benign, with no disease impact.  To better understand
the impact of BRCA variation, scientists study specific genetic variants to assess the individual impact of each variant.

Genetic variants are classified into three categories.  *Pathogenic variants* lead to increased risk of disease.  *Benign variants*
are not associated with increased risk of disease.  *Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)* are those for which the evidence
of disease risk is not clear yet, sometimes because there is not yet enough evidence to classify them as either pathogenic or
benign.  

If a woman has a pathogenic BRCA variant, she has substantially greater risk of developing cancer in her lifetime.  
Approximately 12% of all women will develop breast cancer by the age of 70.  However, a woman with a pathogenic BRCA1
variant can have as high as a 55% chance of developing breast cancer by age 70, and up to a 45% chance for women with
pathogenic BRCA2 variants.  Likewise, 1.3% of all women will develop ovarian cancer in their lifetimes.  This compares
to up to a 39% chance for women with pathogenic BRCA1 variants and up to 17% chance for women with pathogenic BRCA2 variants.  

Thanks to advances in DNA sequencing, individuals can now take genetic tests to screen their DNA for specific known
BRCA variants.  These tests usually require a sample of blood or saliva, and interpreted results from a clinical
geneticist or licenced genetic counselor are usually available within a few weeks.
