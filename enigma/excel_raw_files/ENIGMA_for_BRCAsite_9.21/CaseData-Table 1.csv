"This worksheet is OPTIONAL. It is used in combination with the Variant worksheet, to provide details on individuals as evidence for assertions on the Variant tab.
Please submit *either* aggregate data on the Variant tab (e.g. number of individuals with variant) *or* individual-level data on the CaseData tab. Data submitted on the CaseData tab will be summed by ClinVar to provide the aggregated data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Required. This value is used to connect a row on the Variant tab to one or more rows in the CaseData tab. See instructions on the Variant tab.,"Required. Method used to collect the data that supports the assertion of clinical significance. Allowed values: case-control, clinical testing, literature only, reference population, research","Required. The genetic origin of  the variant. Allowed values: biparental, de novo, germline, maternal, paternal, somatic, uniparental, unknown. Note that biparental and uniparental are intended for the context of uniparental disomy. If you'd like to indicate zygosity, please use the Zygosity column (T).","Required: Indicate whether or not the individual had the condition. Allowed values: yes, no, unknown.","Required only for structural variants. Allowed values: SNP array, Oligo array, Read depth, Paired-end mapping, One end anchored assembly, Sequence alignment, Optical mapping, Curated. ","Optional. Use this column for a list of clinical features that were observed in this individual (not all the clinical features that are associated with the condition). HPO terms may be used to indicate the clinical features. Separate multiple terms with a semicolon. If you also wish to provide a free text comment on the observed phenotype, please use the Condition comment column. 
",Optional. Tissue sampled to assay the variation. Highly recommended for somatic variants. Free text.,"Optional. Sex of the individual sampled. Allowed values: female, male. ","Optional. The age at time of testing for the individual in this sample, with units.  Please use integers only (no decimals) and a single unit of age (e.g. either years or months, but not both). For prenatal testing, use number of months gestation. For ages <1 year, use number of months. For ages over 85 years, please report >85 years, not the specific age. ","Optional. Multiple values allowed, separated by vertical bar (|). Note that multiple values indicate the combination of ethnicities for the individual.

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/GTR/standard_terms/population_group.txt","Optional. Can be used to indicate country, continent, or a region. Separate multiple values by semi-colon.",Optional. Use this column to describe the indication(s) which prompted genetic testing. We strongly recommend using standard terminology (e.g. MedGen terms http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/) rather than free text.,"Optional. Yes/no; reporting whether another member of the family has the reported condition. Does not require that other family members were included in the observation set. A free text comment can also be provided as ""Comment on evidence"" (column X).",Optional. Free text describing the condition observed in individuals with this variant.,,Optional. Indicate whether the individual with the variant was the proband. Yes/no.,"Optional. If you would like to indicate which cases (represented on different rows) were part of the same family, please provide an anonymous identifier for the family.",Optional. Indicate whether segregation was observed for the individual with the variant. Yes/no.,Optional: Indicate whether the individual demonstrates mosaicism for the variant. Yes/no.,"Optional. Indicate zygosity  for the variant in the individual. Single heterozygote, compound heterozygote, homozygote, hemizygote.",Optional. Indicate co-occurring pathogenic variants in the same gene in this individual.,Optional. Indicate co-occurring pathogenic variants in other genes in this individual.,"Optional. Citations documenting the evidence. Any of PubMed, PubMedCentral, DOI, NCBI Bookshelf combined with the id in that database (e.g. PMID:123456, PMCID:PMC3385229, NBK:56955).  Separate multiple citations by a semicolon.

","Optional. Citations that require a URL, or that do not have an identifier in the one of the resources indicated in the Evidence citations column. Separate multiple citations/URLs by a vertical bar (|).",Optional. Free text comment on the evidence provided.,,"Optional. The name or type of test used to identify this variant. If the test is registered with the Genetic Test Registry (GTR), please submit the GTR Test ID, e.g. GTR000074114.1.","Optional.  Type of platform used for data capture, e.g. next-gen sequencing, microarray.","Optional.  Name of platform used for data capture, e.g. HiSeq, MiSeq.","Optional.  Free text describing the experimental method used to generate support.

","Optional.  The primary intent of the method used to generate the data provided in the submission. Allowed values: discovery, validation, assert pathogenicity.","Optional.  Citation(s) documenting this method. PubMed ID, in the format PMID:123456.  Multiples separated by a semicolon.",Optional.  Description of key software with explicit representation of name and version.,"Optional.  Purpose of the software. e.g. alignment, variant calling.",,,,,,,,
