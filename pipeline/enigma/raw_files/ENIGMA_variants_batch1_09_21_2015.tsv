This worksheet is REQUIRED for submission. All assertions are reported on this worksheet. Evidence for the assertions may be provided on this worksheet as aggregate data *OR* on the CaseData worksheet as individual data. Please do not provide evidence both ways to avoid double-counting.				Options to define the reported variants: - Define sequence variants by HGVS expression in columns D-E  - *or* define sequence variants by chromosome coordinates in columns F-K - Define structural variants in columns F-I *and* L-V; see cell M1 for more information on structural variant coordinates				Detailed information about reporting condition is available here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/faq_submitters/#pheno  To identify the condition for which you are making an assertion of clinical significance: - provide a database identifer, e.g. an OMIM ID or an HPO ID, in the Condition ID type and Condition ID value columns. If you prefer a different name for the condition, you may also provide that preferred term in the Preferred condition name column (only provide one name; do not use this column to provide multiple alternate names for the condition). - if there is no database identifer for the condition, please provide your term for the condition in the Preferred condition name column. - if you only know the indication for testing, please submit "not provided" as the Preferred condition name and submit the indication for testing in the Indication column (column BL on this tab, or column L on the CaseData tab).   If you are submitting multiple conditions for a variant to indicate they are observed together in the same individual(s), please store that on one row as a list of conditions If you are submitting multiple conditions to indicate that the variant can be associated with one or the other condition, please store the variant on multiple rows, one per condition.																You may submit aggregate data on the Variant tab *or* individual data on the CaseData tab but not both, to prevent double-counting. Data submitted on the CaseData tab will be summed by ClinVar and included in aggregate data.

Optional, but highly recommended.  The stable unique identifier your organization uses to identifiy this variant. This identifier will be public so should not include protected health information. 	Required if you are also providing data on the CasesData or FunctionalEvidence tab, to connect rows on the two tabs. If a variant is submitted with only one condition on the Variant tab, you can use the HGVS or chromosome coordinates as the Linking ID. If a variant is submitted more than once with different conditions on the Variant tab, a Linking ID that is specific to each variant-condition pair should be provided.	Optional.  This must be the preferred symbol from HGNC, if available. Separate multiple symbols with a semi-colon.	Required for sequence variants if chromosome and some conbination of start and stop are not provided. The reference sequence for the HGVS expression provided in the next column, e.g. NM_000492.3, NG_016465.3, or NC_000007.13. 	Required for sequence variants if start and stop are not provided.  Provide the c. or g. portion of the nucleotide HGVS expression(s) for the variants being reported related to condition.  (http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/examplesDNA.html, http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/standards.html). Can also be used for a haplotype or compound heterozygotes, e.g.  c.[76A>C;105G>A]  or  c.[76A>C];[105G>A] .    	Optional.  A set of alternative,  common, or legacy names for the variant, or an alternate HGVS expression, e.g. for protein. Separate multiple names with a vertical bar (|).	Optional. For variants that are assigned official allele names, e.g. CYP3A4*18 for one of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP3A4; or HLA-DRA*0102 for the MHC gene HLA-DRA.	Optional.  A URL that points to this variant on your organization's website and that does not match the pattern of Base URL (SubmissionInfo tab) + Local ID (Variant tab).	Required if "Preferred condition name" is not supplied.  Please specify the database for the ID in the Condition ID value column.   Allowed values are: OMIM, MeSH, MedGen, UMLS, Orphanet, HPO.  If you use a different source, please check with us first.	Required if "Preferred condition name" is not supplied.  Please specify the identifier from the database referenced in the Condition ID type column. If there are multiple values, they all need to be from the same source, and separated by a semicolon. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/faq_submitters/#examples for examples of identifiers. Values may include both diseases and phenotypes (but not genes).  	Required but defaults to Disease if not filled in. Allowed spreadsheet values are Disease, DrugResponse, BloodGroup, Finding.  Use Finding for clinical findings/features.	Required. Click cell for drop-down list; allowed values include Pathogenic, Likely pathogenic, Uncertain significance, Likely benign, Benign, association, drug response, confers sensitivity, protective, risk factor, other, not provided. If "other" or "drug response", please expand "Clinical Significance - more" columns to provide additional information.	Required, if available: date the clinical significance of the variant was last evaluated by the submitter (not the date the patient was evaluated in the clinic).  If not available, leave blank.  If  only month/year is provided we will convert it to the first day of the month.  If only year is provided it will be converted to the first day of the first month of the year. Please use the format  yyyy-mm-dd.	Optional; required for expert panel and professional society submissions. Free text name of the document in Assertion method citation, describing the method and criteria that were used to make the assertion of clinical significance. 	Optional; required for expert panel and professional society submissions; optional for others. Citation or URL describing the method and criteria used to make assertions of clinical significance.  	Optional.  Supported values are from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Allowed values include: Autosomal dominant inheritance, Autosomal recessive inheritance, Autosomal unknown, Codominant, Genetic anticipation, Mitochondrial inheritance, Sex-limited autosomal dominant, Somatic mutation, Sporadic,  X-linked inheritance, Y-linked inheritance, Other.  If you provide Other, please specify, e.g. Other:new mode of inheritance.  NOTE:  This mode of inheritance value is relative to the variation, not to the disease.	Optional.  Citations documenting the clinical significance. Any of PubMed, PubMedCentral, DOI, NCBI Bookshelf combined with the id in that database (e.g. PMID:123456,  PMCID:PMC3385229, NBK:56955).  Separate multiple citations by a semicolon.	Optional.  Citations that require a URL, or that do not have an identifier in one of the resources indicated in the Clinical significance citations column. Separate multiple citations/URLs by a vertical bar (|).	Optional, but highly encouraged.  Free text describing the rationale for the clinical significance.	Required if 'other' is selected for clinical significance. Please provide the new value for clinical significance.    Optional for clinical significance of  "drug response".  Allows a submitter value describing  the drug response, e.g. "likely responsive".  This value should be short for display purposes.	Optional.  The condition for which the drug response is relevant. Separate multiple conditions by a semicolon.	Optional. Functional consequence describes the effect of the variation on the function of the gene product; it is based on experimental evidence and is distinct from predicted molecular consequence (e.g. missense, frameshift). You can find allowed terms in: - Sequence Ontology (http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/obob.cgi), e.g. mutation affecting splicing (SO:1000071) - VariO (http://www.variationontology.org/cgi-bin/amivario/browse.cgi), e.g. effect on RNA splicing function (VariO:0397) - LOVD Separate multiple terms by a semicolon.

Allowed values: case-control, clinical testing, literature only, reference population, research.	Required. The genetic origin of  the variant. Allowed values: biparental, de novo, germline, maternal, paternal, somatic, uniparental, unknown. Note that biparental and uniparental are intended for the context of uniparental disomy. If you'd like to indicate zygosity, please report counts of homozygotes and heterozygotes in columns BU-BW. 	Required. Indicate whether or not the individual(s) had the condition. Allowed values: yes, no, unknown.	Required for updates or if accession numbers were reserved. For new submissions, this accession number will be returned to you after processing of your submission. Provide the SCV for your submission (not the RCV).
