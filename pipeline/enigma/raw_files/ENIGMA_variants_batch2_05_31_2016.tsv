This worksheet is REQUIRED for submission. All assertions are reported on this worksheet. Evidence for the assertions may be provided on this worksheet as aggregate data *OR* on the CaseData worksheet as individual data. Please do not provide evidence both ways to avoid double-counting.				Options to define the reported variants: - Define sequence variants by HGVS expression in columns D-E  - *or* define sequence variants by chromosome coordinates in columns F-K - Define structural variants in columns F-I *and* L-V; see cell M1 for more information on structural variant coordinates								Use only 1-based coordinates, not 0-based.  If the exact coordinates (to basepair resolution) of the variant call are known, enter only the start and stop coordinates.  Otherwise, use outer_start (lower value) and inner_start (upper value) to define the interval in which the call begins. Likewise, use inner_stop (lower value) and outer_stop (upper value) to define the interval in which the call ends.  If only the minimal region is known, use inner_start and inner_stop. If only the maximum region is known, use outer_start and outer_stop.  You must enter either one set of coordinates (start and stop, outers only, or inners only) or two sets of coordinates (inners and outers).																			Detailed information about reporting condition is available here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/faq_submitters/#pheno  To identify the condition for which you are making an assertion of clinical significance: - provide a database identifer, e.g. an OMIM ID or an HPO ID, in the Condition ID type and Condition ID value columns. If you prefer a different name for the condition, you may also provide that preferred term in the Preferred condition name column (only provide one name; do not use this column to provide multiple alternate names for the condition). - if there is no database identifer for the condition, please provide your term for the condition in the Preferred condition name column. - if you only know the indication for testing, please submit "not provided" as the Preferred condition name and submit the indication for testing in the Indication column (column BL on this tab, or column L on the CaseData tab).   If you are submitting multiple conditions for a variant to indicate they are observed together in the same individual(s), please store that on one row as a list of conditions If you are submitting multiple conditions to indicate that the variant can be associated with one or the other condition, please store the variant on multiple rows, one per condition.																			You may submit aggregate data on the Variant tab *or* individual data on the CaseData tab but not both, to prevent double-counting. Data submitted on the CaseData tab will be summed by ClinVar and included in aggregate data.
