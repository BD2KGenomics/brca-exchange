GENERAL NOTES ON REFSEQ NUMBERING AND SPLICING

MINUS VS PLUS STRAND NUMBERING
Genes are transcribed from 5' to 3'
For plus strand genes (e.g. BRCA2) this correlates to reading from left to right
    so genomic position increases from left to right
(As you move from left to right along the genomic sequence, the genomic position increases
AND the position in the cDNA trasncript increases)
This means that for plus strand genes the exon start position is ALWAYS less than
    the exon end position and that native splice acceptors have a lower genomic position
    than native splice donors in the same exon
For minus strand genes (e.g. BRCA1) this correlates to reading from right to left
    so genomic position increases from right to left AND decreases from left to right
(As you move from the start of the cDNA nucleotide sequence, the cDNA position increases
AND the genomic position decreases)
This means that for minus strand genes the exon start position is ALWAYS greater than
    the exon end position and that native splice acceptors have a higher genomic position
    than native splice donors in the same exon

REFSEQ NUMBERING
RefSeq numbering starts to the right of the first base
This effects the numbering for the lefthand side of genes when reading from left to right
    in a layout where genomic position increases when you read from left to right
For plus strand genes (e.g. BRCA2) this means that the RefSeq exon start genomic position
    (which is the leftmost position in a layout where genomic position increases from left to right)
    refers to the base immediately to the left of the first base of the exon
    this base is the last base of the intron and is referred to as the -1 position in transcript coordinates
        (e.g. c.476-1)
    so the exon actually starts at varExonStart + 1 which is the genomic position of the first base in the exon
        because numbering increases from left to right so this is the base to the left of varExonStart
For minus strand genes (e.g. BRCA1) this means that the RefSeq exon end genomic position position
    (which is the leftmost position in a layout where genomic position increases from left to right
        AND is the rightmost position in a layout where genomic position decreases form left to right)
    refers to the base immediately to the right of the last base of the exon (when looking at a layout
        where numbering decreases from left to right)
    this base in the first base of the intorn and is referred to as the +1 position in transcript coordinates
    (e.g. 4185+1)
    so the exon actually ends at varExonEnd + 1 which is the genomic position of the last base in the exon
        because numbering decreases from left to right this is the base that is to the left of varExonEnd

SPLICING AND SPLICE POSITIONS
Native splice acceptors are located at the 5' ends of exons (near exonStart)
Native splice donors are located at the 3' ends of exons (near exonEnd)
For splice donors:
    splicing occurs between the last base of the exon and the first base of the intron
    this means that the last base in the exon is considered the wild-type splice cut position
        (the function to get FASTA sequences is inclusive of the endpoints so this is the last base included)
    this also means that the first base in the intron is considered the wild-type splice donor position
        (per HCI PRIORS website)
    For example in a plus strand gene (BRCA2):
        c.7617 (g.32356609) is the last base in the exon and is the wild-type cut position
        and c.7617+1 (g.32356610) is the first base in the intron and is the wild-type donor position
        So the donor position is to the right of the cut position
            (when looking at a layout where numbering increases from left to right)
    For example in a minus strand gene (BRCA1):
        c.441 (g.43104122) is the last base in the exon and is the wild-type cut position
        and c.441+1 (g.43104121) is the first base in the intron and is the wild-type donor position
        So the donor position is to the right of the cut position
            (when looking at a layout where numbering decreases from left to right)
For splice acceptors:
    splicing occurs between the last base of the intron and the first base of the exon
    this means that the first base in the exon is considered the wild-type splice cut position
        (the function to get FASTA sequences is inclusive of the endpoints to this is the first base included)
    this also means that the last base in the intron is considered the wild-type splice acceptor position
        (which matches the guidelines used for splice donors on the HCI PRIORS website)
    For example in a minus strand gene (BRCA1):
        c.5194 (g.43057135) is the first base in the exon and is the wild-type cut posiiton
        and c.5194-1 (g.43057136) is the last base in the intron and is the wild-type acceptor position
        So the acceptor position is to the left of the cut position
            (when looking at a layout where numbering decreases from left to right)
    For example in a plus strand gene (BRCA2):
        c.317 (g.32325076) is the first base in the exon and is the wild-type cut position
        and c.317-1 (g.32325075) is the last base in the intron and is the wild-type acceptor position
        So the acceptor position is to the left of the cut position
            (when looking at a layout where numbering increases from left to right)
