The BRCA Exchange is the largest public source of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant information available. The mobile app provides a simplified interface to search the BRCA Exchange for BRCA1/2 variant information and expert classifications of pathogenicity in real time. In addition to providing access to the variant information displayed in the web portal, users can follow variants of interest and receive notifications when their status is updated.

The BRCA Exchange mobile app provides information on catalogued BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic variants, including variant classifications that have been curated by an international expert panel, the ENIGMA consortium, to assess their pathogenicity (associated disease risk).  Variants listed as ‘not yet reviewed’ will be classified by the ENIGMA consortium soon.

The app is free of charge, and is available for Android™ and Apple iPhone/iPad® devices. Links to the Google Play and Apple App Store, respectively, are below.
