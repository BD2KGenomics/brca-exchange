## BRCAExchange.org - Submission Policy (11 Jan 2017)

The BRCA Exchange is developing processes for direct submission of variant data to the BRCA Exchange. The variant data will be shared for public view on the open tiers of the BRCA Exchange. The purpose of this submission policy is to guide discussions with potential submitters internationally about respective responsibilities. This draft of the submission policy focuses on ethics and accountability, and will need to be supplemented by clinically driven guidelines on what it means to make a “complete” and “accurate” submission (similar to the Clinvar submission guidelines [here](https://clinicalgenome.org/data-sharing/data-submission-toolkit/policies-for-clinical-laboratory-submission-of-variants-to-clinvar/). It should be read in harmony with the existing Disclaimer that is already on the web..

## Submission Policy (DRAFT 11 Jan 2017)

Data submitted to the BRCA Exchange will be made available on the open access tiers of the BRCA Exchange for unrestricted public view, redistribution and reuse. Submitters are responsible to ensure submissions are accurate and complete. They should inform the BRCA Exchange in a timely manner of any updates, errors or omissions. Submitters must also ensure they comply with ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. In particular, submissions must not include personal or confidential data unless the submitter has obtained and archived the appropriate consents and/or approvals. The BRCA Exchange will take all reasonable steps to ensure submitters are appropriately acknowledged for their contributions.
