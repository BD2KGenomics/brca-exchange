ENIGMA \(Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles\) is an international consortium of researchers who provide expert opinions on the clinical significance of BRCA1, BRCA2, and other breast cancer genes. This consortium serves as the BRCA expert review body of ClinGen. ENIGMA uses a multi-factorial analysis that weighs together many types of variant data, such as population frequencies, protein and transcript structure, and epidemiological measures. The analysis is tuned specifically for the BRCA genes, and subsumes IARC criteria alongside other statistical analyses developed by ENIGMA collaborators.
