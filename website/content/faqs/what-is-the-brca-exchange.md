The BRCA Exchange is a curated data platform that provides information on variants of specific genes: _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_. Rather than contributing new information about a variant, the BRCA Exchange becomes a single source that collects and organizes existing information. The BRCA Exchange retrieves data from a variety of databases, such as ClinVar and LOVD. Using these sources, BRCA Exchange answers three basic questions about a variant:

* What is the most definitive clinical interpretation available for this variant?
* When was this interpretation made?
* What publicly available data informed this interpretation?

There are two data views used by BRCA Exchange to aid researchers and clinicians who work with _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_. The default, or _summary_, view of BRCA Exchange will only display variant aliases, [ENIGMA](/what-is-enigma-and-how-does-it-determine-variant-classifications.md) variant interpretations, and a brief interpretation history. The ENIGMA Consortium assesses variant pathogenicity using an expertly developed set of _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ classification criteria. The _All Public_ view contains all publicly available data on a variant. Thus, this view of the data provides a more complete, but also more complicated, characterization of a variant. Using multiple large-scale sources and two different portals, BRCA Exchange serves as a contextualized resource for curation of BRCA variant data.
