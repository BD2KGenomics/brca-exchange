Rather than obtaining data through single-submitters, BRCA Exchange aggregates large scale data from database contributors. Thus, public databases such as ClinVar and LOVD are sources for the BRCA Exchange. Furthermore, the data portal has a separate instance where only the interpretations from the ENIGMA Expert Review panel can be seen to provide a more simple view of trustworthy information.

Such aggregation can enrich BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant data by bringing together different kinds of data on the same variant. Instead of searching through multiple databases separately, trying to piece together a variant's significance, in BRCA Exchange a user can view all the data in one place. Additionally, many public databases collect general genome-wide variant data on many diverse disease genes, whereas the BRCA Exchange is precisely defined to streamline the sharing of specific types of data for the well-known BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in order to facilitate variant interpretations. For example, we use ExAC datasets that have TCGA data removed.

Finally, using two different data views, a variant can be reviewed both on an high level or in more detail. In order to provide unambiguous interpretations, one data view provides only ENIGMA interpretations. However, more complete data is still available through the All Public view. The comprehensive data provided in this second view includes classic genomic statistics, such as allele frequencies, as well as data unique to BRCA1 and BRCA2, such as priors calculated from multifactorial analyses of BRCA variants.
