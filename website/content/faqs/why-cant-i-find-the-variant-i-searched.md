There are two main reasons you might not find a variant you searched. The first is that the variant you searched originates from a privately operated testing company. Thus, the company does not submit its variants to public databases, and is not available to BRCA Exchange. Many, but not all, private companies contribute to public databases, so your variant might also be in the submission process. A second reason your search might have failed is that you misspelled the variant in the search query. Variant names are cryptic, so try double checking to make sure you entered it correctly. As a reminder, a variety of nomenclature standards can be searched in our search box: 

* BRCA1 or BRCA2 \(Gene Symbol\)
* BRCA1 c.1105G&gt;A \(Gene + HGVS Nucleotide\) 
* c.1105G&gt;A \(HGVS Nucleotide\)
* chr17:g.43058314 \(Genomic Nomenclature\)
* IVS19-1179G&gt;T, 2043G&gt;C \(BIC Designation\)
* NM\_007924.3 \(Transcript Identifier\)
* p.\(Pro1238Leu\) \(HGVS Protein\)
* P1238L \(Abbreviated Amino Acid Change\)
