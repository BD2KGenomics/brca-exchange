While it is still only used by a small population, genetic testing -- including BRCA testing -- is on the rise.  Between 2009 and 2014, BRCA testing rates increased 2.3 to 3 times.<sup>1</sup> This rise is driven by greater public awareness of how mutations in the _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ genes can increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers.  While the general lifetime risk of female breast and ovarian cancer are 12.3% and 1.6% respectively, those numbers rise to as high as 87% and 63% respectively for _BRCA1_ carriers, and 84% and 27% respectively for _BRCA2_ carriers.<sup>2</sup>  These cancers are in theory preventable through screening and intervention.

While some BRCA mutations increase the risk of disease, others do not, and individuals with these mutations (also referred to as “genetic variants”, or more concisely, “variants”) do not need to be concerned that they will increase the risk of cancer in themselves of their family members.  Distinguishing these innocuous variants from the harmful ones requires careful analysis by expert variant curators.  This analysis in turn depends on the availability of high-quality data on BRCA variants.  BRCA Exchange makes high quality, informative data publicly available, to benefit variant curators, genetic counselors and clinicians worldwide.

Over the next year, BRCA Exchange is planning three specific expansions to make high-quality data available for more variants:

* We will integrate data from the Genome Aggregation Database<sup>3</sup> at the Broad Institute. This database helps scientists identify genetic variants that are not likely to be harmful, because they are frequent in some population in the world.  

* We will implement expert-defined algorithms to estimate the chance that a variant will lead to disease.  Unlike many others, this algorithm is not limited in scope to variants in which one single nucleotide is replaced with another, and can also predict on variants that involve small insertions or deletions of one or more nucleotides.

* We are collaborating with international researchers to pioneer “federated analysis” methods.  These novel approaches allow researchers to analyze data that they would not be able to access normally, due to legal or regulatory restrictions.  By “bringing the code to the data”, researchers can analyze the data without any need to transfer it.   This could open many new avenues for global data sharing.

By population frequency estimates, these steps will improve the quality of data in an estimated 967,680 individuals and families worldwide with rare BRCA variants.  This estimates reflects that the world population is now roughly 7.58 billion people,<sup>4</sup> and that the fraction of people who carry rare BRCA variants (those that occur in less than 1% of the population)  is 12.6e-053.

The annual cost of supporting BRCA Exchange is estimated at $469,500.  Combining this with the population figure above, each dollar contributed to BRCA Exchange will lead to better variant information for upwards of 2 individuals in the next year alone.
