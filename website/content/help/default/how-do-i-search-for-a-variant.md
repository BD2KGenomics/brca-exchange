Welcome to the BRCA Exchange, where you can search _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ variants in our expertly curated and maintained data portal. This site allows you to access important, up-to-date information about a BRCA variant, such as its clinical significance.
To begin, notice the search bar on the home page. This search bar accesses our databases directly, and can handle any identifying names for the variant or variants you are searching for. Here are some examples of what can be typed in this search box:

* _BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_ \(Gene Symbol\)
* _BRCA1_ c.1105G&gt;A \(Gene + HGVS Nucleotide\)
* c.1105G&gt;A \(HGVS Nucleotide\)
* chr17:g.4305831 \(Genomic Nomenclature\)
* IVS19-1179G&gt;T, 2043G&gt;C \(BIC Designation\)
* NM\_007924.3 \(Transcript Identifier\)
* _p.\(Pro1238Leu\)_ \(HGVS Protein\)
* _P1238L_ \(Abbreviated Amino Acid Change\)

Clicking the magnifying glass will execute a search for the variants that fit your search criteria. To learn more about HGVS nomenclature, visit the HGVS Nomenclature portion of the Reference Guide \(found below\). A table of all matching variants is provided once you have used the search box. You can sort search results alphabetically by clicking any column header once. The list will be alphabetized based on the column you clicked. Clicking once more will sort search results in reverse-alphabetical order.
When you have identified your variant of interest in the list, you can click anywhere in the variant’s data row to access the Variant Detail Page. The Variant Detail Page provides an organized summary of the searched variant’s information, including its aliases, its clinical significance, the date it was last evaluated, and other relevant data. Information is grouped into tiles for your convenience.

Please note that searching for a variant using a genomic coordinate will return all variants that match according to any of the hg38, hg19, or hg18 genome builds. For example, if you search for a variant using its hg38 coordinate, and it happens to match the coordinate of some variant  in the hg19 build, both variants will be returned in the search. In this case, make sure to verify that the coordinate\(s\) and genome build are correct once you navigate to the Variant Details Page.
