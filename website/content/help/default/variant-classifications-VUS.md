#### What is a Variant of Uncertain Significance?

Everybody has BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but some people’s BRCA genes have slight differences. These genetic differences are called **variants**, which can sometimes, but not always, increase risk of cancer for individuals who carry them. A genetic test is used to reveal if a person carries variants in their  BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Variants are classified according to whether they affect your risk of cancer or not. Not all variants have classifications.

When a variant is classified as a _**Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS)**_, scientists do not have enough evidence, or the evidence is not clear enough, to classify the variant as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, likely benign, or benign.

A VUS result can be due insufficient research, insufficient clinical data, or evidence that is unclear about the variant’s effect on the gene’s function. Thus, it is hard for scientists to make assessments about cancer risk.

Scientists are continually assessing VUSs to try to classify them as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, or likely benign. This process does not have a set time span, because it is hard to know when new data will become available or additional research will be done on specific variants.

If a test reveals a Variant of Uncertain Significance, this type of test result is inconclusive. That is, it does not confirm or deny an inherited risk for the genes in question. The VUS test result should not be used to alter management. Rather, discussions with a doctor about other risk factors (such as age and family history) should be used to aid decisions about preventative care and treatment.  **Results should always be interpreted with help from genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals.**

Although BRCA Exchange aggregates knowledge about BRCA variants, this site is not intended to provide a clinical diagnosis or medical advice. Please contact a doctor to determine what steps may be necessary after receiving a genetic test result.
