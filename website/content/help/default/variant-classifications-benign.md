#### What is a benign or likely benign variant?

Everybody has BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but some people’s BRCA genes have slight differences. These genetic differences are called **variants**, which can sometimes, but not always, increase risk of cancer for individuals who carry them. A genetic test is used to reveal if a person carries variants in their  BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Variants are classified according to whether they affect your risk of cancer or not. Not all variants have classifications.

When a variant is classified as _**benign**_, scientists have substantial, non-conflicting evidence against the variant being associated with a greatly increased (high) risk of cancer. These variants are also labeled as having _**Little Clinical Significance**_.

Similarly, when a variant is classified as likely benign, scientists have non-conflicting evidence against the variant being associated with high risk of cancer. However, likely benign variants do not have quite as much evidence to support their classification as benign variants.

If a test reveals a benign or _**likely benign**_ variant, then this variant alone is not likely to cause hereditary cancer. **Results should always be interpreted with help from genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals.**

Although BRCA Exchange aggregates knowledge about BRCA variants, this site is not intended to provide a clinical diagnosis or medical advice. Please contact your doctor to determine what steps may be necessary after receiving a genetic test result.

Resources for finding a genetic counselor and understanding genetic test results can be found below, in the “More Resources” section. The classifications provided by the Summary View are made by the ENIGMA consortium. For more information about ENIGMA, please visit their [website](https://enigmaconsortium.org).
