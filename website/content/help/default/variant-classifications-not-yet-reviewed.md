#### What does it mean when a variant is Not Yet Reviewed?

Everybody has BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but some people’s BRCA genes have slight differences. These genetic differences are called variants, which can sometimes, but not always, increase risk of cancer for individuals who carry them. A genetic test is used to reveal if a person carries variants in their  BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Variants are classified according to whether they affect your risk of cancer or not. Not all variants have classifications.

A variant that is Not Yet Reviewed is a variant that has not yet been interpreted by ENIGMA scientists. A Not Yet Reviewed variant is not the same as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS).

A genetic testing company might provide an interpretation for a variant that has not yet been reviewed (confirmed) by the experts at ENIGMA. **Results should always be interpreted with help from genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals.**

Although BRCA Exchange aggregates knowledge about BRCA variants, this site is not intended to provide a clinical diagnosis or medical advice. Please contact a doctor to determine what steps may be necessary after receiving a genetic test result.

Resources for finding a genetic counselor and understanding genetic test results can be found below, in the “More Resources” section. The classifications provided by the Summary View are made by the ENIGMA consortium. For more information about ENIGMA, please visit their [website](https://enigmaconsortium.org).
