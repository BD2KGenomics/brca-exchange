#### What is a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant?

Everybody has BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but some people’s BRCA genes have slight differences. These genetic differences are called **variants**, which can sometimes, but not always, increase risk of cancer for individuals who carry them. A genetic test is used to reveal if a person carries variants in their  BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Variants are classified according to whether they affect your risk of cancer or not. Not all variants have classifications.

When a variant is classified as _**pathogenic**_, scientists have strong non-conflicting evidence to show that the variant is associated with a greatly increased (high) risk of cancer. 

Similarly, when a variant is classified as likely pathogenic, scientists have non-conflicting evidence to suggest an increased  risk of cancer, though there is not as much evidence to support their classification as with a pathogenic variant. 

If a gene test reveals a pathogenic or _**likely pathogenic**_ variant, this is important information for healthcare provider(s). Though the test result shows that the carrier is at increased risk of cancer due to variation in the specific gene in question, other risk factors (such as age and family history) may be relevant to the type and timing of preventative care and treatment. **Results should always be interpreted with help from genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals.**

Although BRCA Exchange aggregates knowledge about BRCA variants, this site is not intended to provide a clinical diagnosis or medical advice. Please contact a doctor to determine what steps may be necessary after receiving a genetic test result.

Resources for finding a genetic counselor and understanding your genetic test result can be found below, in the “More Resources” section. The classifications provided by the Summary View are made by the ENIGMA consortium.
