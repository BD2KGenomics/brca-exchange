ENIGMA \(Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles\) is an international consortium of researchers who provide expert opinions on the clinical significance of variation in _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, and other breast cancer genes. This consortium serves as the BRCA expert review body of ClinGen. ENIGMA uses classification criteria tuned specifically for the BRCA genes to evaluate the clinical significance of _BRCA1/2_ variants. Evidence reviewed includes many different types of data, including population frequencies, clinical information, and epidemiological measures. This data also includes effects of variation on transcript and protein structure and function. All available information is combined to estimate the probability that a variant is cancer-causing, using qualitative \(rules-based\) criteria and/or the quantitative \(statistical\) multi-factorial likelihood analysis method.
