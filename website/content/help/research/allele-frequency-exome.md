#### Numerical ESP Data
The NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project is yet another contributor of allele frequency data to the BRCA Exchange. The Exome Sequencing Project \(ESP\) aims to “to discover novel genes and mechanisms contributing to heart, lung and blood disorders by pioneering the application of next-generation sequencing of the protein coding regions of the human genome across diverse, richly-phenotyped populations and to share these datasets and findings with the scientific community to extend and enrich the diagnosis, management and treatment of heart, lung and blood disorders” \([NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project](http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/)\).

* #### Allele Frequency (ESP) ((Allele_Frequency_ESP))

* #### EA Allele Frequency (ESP) ((EA_Allele_Frequency_ESP))
	Allele frequency in European-American populations, per ESP
* #### AA Allele Frequency (ESP) ((AA_Allele_Frequency_ESP))
	Allele frequency in African-American populations, per ESP
