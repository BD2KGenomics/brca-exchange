* #### Clinical Significance ((report-Clinical_Significance_ClinVar))

	These fields, extracted from [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), relate to variant clinical classification from individual submitters to ClinVar \(includes repeated information from ENIGMA and BIC tiles\).

	##### What do these classifications mean?
	The below classifications will be found in ClinVar's "clinical significance" field. They are implemented per [recommendations by ACMG/AMP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25741868) for variants interpreted by Mendelian disorders.

	* Pathogenic
	* Likely pathogenic
	* Likely benign
	* Benign
	* Uncertain Significance

* #### Submitter ((report-Submitter_ClinVar))
	This field provides the name of the submitting organization. From ClinVar.
* #### SCV Accession ((report-SCV_ClinVar))
	This is the SCV accession from the ClinVar repository.
* #### Date last updated \(ClinVar\) ((report-Date_Last_Updated_ClinVar))
	The field that shows the date the variant was last submitted to ClinVar. Note that this date is not equivalent to the date last evaluated.
* ##### _Coming Soon:_
	Updated Classification descriptions, Information about tile functionality, resources for star review, definition of summary evidence.
