* #### Clinical Significance ((Clinical_significance_ENIGMA))

    This field displays the variantâ€™s clinical classification and supporting information as provided by ENIGMA expert panel review.

	##### What do these classifications mean?
	* Pathogenic variants confer a markedly increased risk of disease.
	* Likely pathogenic variants have good evidence to support an association with markedly increased disease risk.
	* Likely benign variants have good evidence to support no association with markedly increased disease risk.
	* Benign variants are not associated with any markedly increased risk of disease.
	* Variants of uncertain significance \(VUS\) are those for which the evidence of disease risk is not clear yet, sometimes because there is not yet enough evidence to classify them as either pathogenic or benign.

	Markedly increased disease risk for a variant in _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ is currently defined as risk that is sufficient to alter patient management based on detection of that single genetic variant, after considering other non-genetic risk factors for the individual.

* #### Comment on Clinical Significance ((Comment_on_clinical_significance_ENIGMA))
	This field comments on the derivation of the IARC class, provided by ENIGMA.

* #### Assertion Method ((Assertion_method_ENIGMA))
	This field provides the citation or URL describing the method and criteria used to make assertions of clinical significance.

* #### Date last evaluated ((Date_last_evaluated_ENIGMA))
	This is a display of the date on which the clinical significance of the variant was last evaluated by ENIGMA.

* #### Collection Method ((Collection_method_ENIGMA))
	This is the method used to collect the data that supports the assertion of clinical significance. The following values may be listed: case-control, clinical testing, literature only, reference population, research.

* #### Clinical Significance Citation ((Clinical_significance_citations_ENIGMA))
	This field provides citations that document the clinical significance. They may be from PubMed, PubMedCentral, DOI, or NCBI Bookshelf.

* #### Allele Origin ((Allele_origin_ENIGMA))
	Variants are classified as either germline or somatic, depending on how they are acquired. Germline variants are genetic changes that we inherit from our parents. Somatic variants are DNA changes that we acquire over our lifetime, often through exposure to pollutants, toxins, radiation and other carcinogens.
