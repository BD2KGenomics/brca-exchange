For missense variants that occur within a region of the protein with a well-defined three-dimensional structure, bioinformatics and protein structure analysis can help suggest the impact of the variation (1-3). Certain regions in protein structures tend to be more sensitive to variation, such as positions buried within the core of the protein (where variation could destabilize the protein’s structure) and positions near binding sites (where variation could impact the protein’s function). The MuPIT interactive viewer from the CRAVAT project (4) facilitates such analysis by showing the position of the variant in the context of its three-dimensional protein structure.

By clicking on the CRAVAT/MuPIT thumbnail image, the user opens a new browser tab running the interactive MuPIT viewer.  The display is divided into three panels.

The center panel displays the three-dimensional protein structure, and indicates the variant’s location with spacefill spheres. The positions in the structure are also color-coded, per predictions about the impact of variation in those regions. By default, colors at a position are assigned according to the most severe in silico prediction of pathogenicity (6). For example, if the reference base was a ‘C’, and the possible missense variants had respective in silico pathogenicity predictions of 0.67 for ‘A’, 0.33 for ‘G’, and 0.88 for ‘T’, then the position would be color-coded according to the highest prediction score, which is 0.88 for ‘T’. The user can rotate the protein structure by holding down and dragging the mouse.

The rightmost panel provides controls to allow the user to select a different color map, and to change the color of the variant. The available color maps describe:
* In silico prediction of the most sever variant at each position (6)
* Multifactorial analysis, incorporating in silico prediction with probabilities estimated from case-level patient data (7)

Coming soon: color maps currently under development will describe known pathogenic and benign variants, augmented with in silico prediction of whether the pathogenic variants are pathogenic due to impact on splicing or impact on protein function (6).

The leftmost panel displays additional controls, including a link for further help.

CRAVAT and MuPIT are available for missense variants that map to positions within curated three-dimensional protein structures.  It is not available for insertions, deletions, duplications, or positions in regions of the protein where no three-dimensional protein structure has been determined.
