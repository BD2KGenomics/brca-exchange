*Literature Search is a beta feature, so please beware of erroneous or missing results.*

The Literature Search feature provides a list of publications in which a specific variant (and its aliases) are found. This feature uses text mining methods to search the abstract and the body of papers from major journals. If a variant of interest is found within the paper, the publication is listed on its Variant Details Page. Tables and supplementary data files are also searched (1). 

The Literature Search results are displayed near the bottom of the Variant Details page in a table format. This table includes the title, authors, journal, publication date, the variant alias or aliases which matched in the search, the text snippet(s) around the match, and the PubMed ID (PMID). The PubMed ID may be clicked to access the article in PubMed. You may use the “Copy” or “Export” button to copy the table to your clipboard or export it to the file format of your choice.

##### Methods

BRCA Exchange Literature Search was adapted from the text2genome tool. This tool was originally designed to search publications for sequences from genes, as part of the UCSC Genome Browser. It was modified for BRCA Exchange to instead search for variants. Licenses and permissions for full-text mining were obtained by emailing publishers individually, and gaining permissions to access full-body texts. While UCSC’s permissions are not exhaustive, they are substantial.

The text2genome tool was developed by Max Hauessler, Martin Gerner, and Casey M. Bergman (1). Audrey Musselman-Brown implemented the necessary text2genome adaptations for BRCA Exchange. She built upon text2genome, writing software that not only narrowed searches to BRCA1 and BRCA2, but also utilized diverse variant nomenclature and aliases as search terms.
