Columns allow you to filter the variant table (in search results) according to fields found in the tiles on the Variant Details Page. Column selectors correspond to each tile’s fields, whose descriptions are found above. These selectors allow you to include any tile’s field as its own column in your search results. You can then sort results using added columns.
