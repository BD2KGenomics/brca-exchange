Downloading Variant Data
============================

To download the variant data click on the ‘Download’ button located above the search bar within the Variants Table page. When you click on it the data that is downloaded is a comma delimited .csv file containing the set of variant details for the variants that matched the search and/or filtering criteria. The first row in the file represent the column labels.


How do I use Column Selectors?
============================

Columns allow you to filter the variant table (in search results) according to fields found in the tiles on the Variant Details Page. Column selectors correspond to each tile’s fields, whose descriptions are found above. These selectors allow you to include any tile’s field as its own column in your search results. You can then sort results using added columns.
