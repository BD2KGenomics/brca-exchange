There are two main reasons you might not find a variant you searched. The first is that the variant you searched originates from a privately operated testing company that has not yet shared the variant with a public database. A second reason your search might have failed is that you misspelled the variant in the search query. Variant names are cryptic, so try double checking to make sure you entered it correctly. As a reminder, a variety of nomenclature standards can be searched in our search box: 

* _BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_ \(Gene Symbol\)
* _BRCA1_ c.1105G&gt;A \(Gene + HGVS Nucleotide\) 
* c.1105G&gt;A \(HGVS Nucleotide\)
* chr17:g.43058314 \(Genomic Nomenclature\)
* IVS19-1179G&gt;T, 2043G&gt;C \(BIC Designation\)
* NM\_007924.3 \(Transcript Identifier\)
* p.\(Pro1238Leu\) \(HGVS Protein\)
* P1238L \(Abbreviated Amino Acid Change\)
