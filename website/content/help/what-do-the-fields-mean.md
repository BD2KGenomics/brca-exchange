The Variant Details page is displayed once you have chosen a single variant from a set of search results. This page is a “bird’s eye view” of the variant in question, based on publicly available data. This page will tell you all the standard aliases of the variant, its most definitive classification, and a brief history of variant interpretations. These details originate from large databases, rather than individual submissions from people who have undergone BRCA testing.
