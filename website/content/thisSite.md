# About this Site


This site provides information on catalogued _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ genetic variants.  By default, it shows variants that have been curated and classified by an international expert panel, the [ENIGMA](http://enigmaconsortium.org/) consortium, to assess their *pathogenicity* (associated disease risk).  Optional settings allow the user to look at unclassified variants.  In most cases, these variants are awaiting expert review, and their pathogenicity has not yet been established.

The <a href="https://brcaexchange.org">BRCA Exchange</a> website is a product of the BRCA Challenge of the <a href="https://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a>. The web site and underlying database were developed by Molly Zhang, Charles Markello, Mary Goldman, Brian Craft, Zack Fischmann, Joe Thomas, David Haussler, Melissa Cline and Benedict Paten at the Computational Genomics Lab at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, Faisal Alquaddoomi, Marc Zimmermann and <a href="http://ratschlab.org/~raetsch">Gunnar R&auml;tsch</a> at <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich</a>, and Rachel Liao of the <a href="https://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a> with input and feedback from Amanda Spurdle and Michael Parsons at <a href="http://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au">Berghofer Medical Research Institute</a>, and other members of the BRCA Challenge working groups.

Variant data on this site are made available using the standards based <a href="https://genomicsandhealth.org/work-products-demonstration-projects/genomics-api">GA4GH Genomics API</a>. For more information, and example usage please visit our <a href="/about/api">API description</a>.
