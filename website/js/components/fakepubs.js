    "abstract": "To determine the relevance of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) in advanced prostate cancer by first examining whether IDC-P was originally present in patients who later developed advanced prostate cancer and then using patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to investigate the response of IDC-P to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).                 We conducted a retrospective pathology review of IDC-P in primary prostate biopsy or surgery specimens from 38 men who subsequently developed advanced prostate cancer. Overall survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. To demonstrate the response of IDC-P to ADT, we established PDXs from seven patients with familial and/or high-risk sporadic prostate cancer. After castration and testosterone restoration of host mice, we measured the volume and proliferation of IDC-P within PDX grafts.                 We found that IDC-P was a prominent feature in the primary prostate specimens, present in 63% of specimens and often co-existing with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Overall survival was similar in patients with or without IDC-P. In the PDXs from all seven patients, IDC-P was identified and present at a similar volume to adenocarcinoma. Residual IDC-P lesions persisted after host castration and, similar to castrate-tolerant adenocarcinoma, testosterone restoration led to tumour regeneration.                 The study showed that IDC-P is prevalent in aggressive prostate cancer and contains cells that can withstand androgen deprivation. Thus, IDC-P appears functionally relevant in advanced prostate cancer. The presence of IDC-P may be a trigger to develop innovative clinical management plans.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy among women worldwide. A major advance in the understanding of the genetic etiology of BC was the discovery of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) genes, which are considered high-penetrance BC genes. In non-carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations, disease susceptibility may be explained of a small number of mutations in BRCA1/2 and a much higher proportion of mutations in ethnicity-specific moderate- and/or low-penetrance genes. In Central and South American populations, studied have focused on analyzing the distribution and prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations and other susceptibility genes that are scarce in Latin America as compared to North America, Europe, Australia, and Israel. Thus, the aim of this review is to present the current state of knowledge regarding pathogenic BRCA variants and other BC susceptibility genes. We conducted a comprehensive review of 47 studies from 12 countries in Central and South America published between 2002 and 2017 reporting the prevalence and/or spectrum of mutations and pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 and other BC susceptibility genes. The studies on BRCA1/2 mutations screened a total of 5956 individuals, and studies on susceptibility genes analyzed a combined sample size of 11,578 individuals. To date, a total of 190 different BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations in Central and South American populations have been reported in the literature. Pathogenic mutations or variants that increase BC risk have been reported in the following genes or genomic regions: ATM, BARD1, CHECK2, FGFR2, GSTM1, MAP3K1, MTHFR, PALB2, RAD51, TOX3, TP53, XRCC1, and 2q35.",

    "abstract": "Breast and/or ovarian cancers are complex multifactorial diseases caused by interaction of both genetic and non-genetic factors and characterized by predisposition to inheritance. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most clinically involved with these kinds of cancer and the spectrum of variants affecting these genes is very wide. In fact, point variants, large or small insertions/deletions, genomic rearrangements can be found in these patients, although a large number of variants with uncertain biological and clinical significance continues to be identified. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is actually the most powerful tool for the discovering of causative mutations and novel disease genes, moreover it allows to make a rapid diagnosis of genetic variants giving fast, inexpensive and detailed genetic information.                 In this study, we report the screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes on 1400 consecutive Caucasian patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer history or family risk, attending the oncogenetic ambulatory at the Foundation Policlinico Agostino Gemelli in Rome.

From a total universe of 853 individual blood samples referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 typing, 256 cases were analyzed by complete direct sequencing of both genes in Myriad Genetics, and the remaining 597 cases were studied by partial sequencing based on founder mutations in a PCR test designed by ourselves (\"Profile Colombia\").                 We found 107 patients carrying deleterious mutations in this group of patients, 69 (64.5%) located in BRCA1, and 38 (35.5%) in BRCA2. Overall, we detected 39 previously unreported mutations in Colombia (22 in BRCA1 and 17 in BRCA2) and only 4 out of the 6 previously reported founder mutations. Sixty four out of 597 patients (10.7%) studied by \"Profile Colombia\" showed mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, and 41/256 patients (16%) showed mutations by complete BRCA1-BRCA2 sequencing.                 The spectrum of 44 different mutations in Colombia as detected in our study is broader than the one previously reported for this country. \"Profile Colombia\" is a useful screening test to establish both founder and new mutations (detection rate of 10.7%) in cases with family history of breast cancer. Complete sequencing shows a detection rate of 16.0%, and should complement the study of the genetic basis of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Detection of circulating tumor DNA can be limited due to their relative scarcity in circulation, particularly while patients are actively undergoing therapy. Exosomes provide a vehicle through which cancer-specific material can be enriched from the compendium of circulating non-neoplastic tissue-derived nucleic acids. We carried out a comprehensive profiling of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exosomal 'surfaceome' in order to identify surface proteins that will render liquid biopsies amenable to cancer-derived exosome enrichment for downstream molecular profiling.                 Surface exosomal proteins were profiled in 13 human PDAC and 2 non-neoplastic cell lines by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 173 prospectively collected blood samples from 103 PDAC patients underwent exosome isolation. Droplet digital PCR was used on 74 patients (136 total exosome samples) to determine baseline KRAS mutation call rates while patients were on therapy. PDAC-specific exosome capture was then carried out on additional 29 patients (37 samples) using an antibody cocktail directed against selected proteins, followed by droplet digital PCR analysis. Exosomal DNA in a PDAC patient resistant to therapy were profiled using a molecular barcoded, targeted sequencing panel to determine the utility of enriched nucleic acid material for comprehensive molecular analysis.                 Proteomic analysis of the exosome 'surfaceome' revealed multiple PDAC-specific biomarker candidates: CLDN4, EPCAM, CD151, LGALS3BP, HIST2H2BE, and HIST2H2BF. KRAS mutations in total exosomes were detected in 44.1% of patients undergoing active therapy compared with 73.0% following exosome capture using the selected biomarkers. Enrichment of exosomal cargo was amenable to molecular profiling, elucidating a putative mechanism of resistance to PARP inhibitor therapy in a patient harboring a BRCA2 mutation.                 Exosomes provide unique opportunities in the context of liquid biopsies for enrichment of tumor-specific material in circulation.

    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a heterogeneous disease with a major heritable component. The different histotypes of invasive disease - high grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid and mucinous - are associated with different underlying genetic susceptibility and epidemiological and lifestyle risk factors, all of which contribute to the different biology and clinical characteristics of each histotype. A combination of familial and population based sequencing studies, and genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a range of genetic susceptibility alleles for EOC comprising rare but highly penetrant genes (e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2) that are responsible for familial clustering of ovarian cancer cases; more moderate penetrance susceptibility genes (e.g. BRIP1, RAD51C/D, MSH6); and multiple common but low penetrance susceptibility alleles identified by GWAS. Identifying genetic risk alleles for ovarian cancer has had a significant impact on disease prevention strategies; for example it is now routine clinical practice for individuals with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations to undergo risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. Because ovarian cancers are commonly diagnosed at a late clinical stage when the prognosis is poor, the continued development of genetic risk prediction and prevention strategies will represent an important approach to reduce mortality due to ovarian cancer. Advances in genomics technologies that enable more high-throughput genetic testing, combined with research studies that identify additional EOC risk alleles will likely provide further opportunities to establish polygenic risk prediction approaches, based on combinations of rare high/moderate penetrance susceptibility genes and common, low penetrance susceptibility alleles. This article reviews the current literature describing the genetic and epidemiological components of ovarian cancer risk, and discusses both the opportunities and challenges in using this information for clinical risk prediction and prevention.",

Our panel contains the highest amount of founder mutations until today and represents the highest percentage (78%) ofBRCA1 andBRCA2 mutation carriers.

Here we report characterization of breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) largely generated from residual tumors following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Experimental Design: PDXs were derived from surgical samples of primary or locally recurrent tumors. Normal and tumor DNA sequencing, RNASeq, and reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) were performed. Phenotypic profiling was performed by determining efficacy of a panel of standard and investigational agents.Results: Twenty-six PDXs were developed from 25 patients. Twenty-two were generated from residual disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 24 were from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These PDXs harbored a heterogeneous set of genomic alterations and represented all TNBC molecular subtypes. On RPPA, PDXs varied in extent of PI3K and MAPK activation. PDXs also varied in their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. PI3K, mTOR, and MEK inhibitors repressed growth but did not cause tumor regression. The PARP inhibitor talazoparib caused dramatic regression in five of 12 PDXs. Notably, four of five talazoparib-sensitive models did not harbor germlineBRCA1/2 mutations, but several had somatic alterations in homologous repair pathways, includingATM deletion andBRCA2 alterations.Conclusions: PDXs capture the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity of TNBC. Here we show that PARP inhibition can have activity beyond germlineBRCA1/2 altered tumors, causing regression in a variety of molecular subtypes. These models represent an opportunity for the discovery of rational combinations with targeted therapies and predictive biomarkers.Clin Cancer Res; 23(21); 6468-77. ©2017 AACR.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer develops as a result of multiple gene mutations in combination with environmental risk factors. Causative variants in genes such as BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 have been shown to account for hereditary nature of certain breast cancers. However,other genes, such as ATM, PALB2, BRIP1, CHEK, BARD1, while lower in frequency, may also increase breast cancer risk. There are few studies examining the role of these causative variants. Our study aimed to examine the clinical and genetic characterization of hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population.                 We tested a panel of 27 genes implicated in breast cancer risk in 240 participants using Next-Generation Sequencing. The prevalence of genetic causative variants was determined and the association between causative variants and clinico-pathological characteristics was analyzed.                 Causative variant rate was 19.2% in the breast cancer (case) group and 12.5% in the high-risk group. In the case group 2.5% of patients carried BRCA1 causative variant, 7.5% BRCA2 variants, 1.7% patients had MUTYH, CHEK or PALB2 variants, and 0.8% patients carried ATM, BARD1, NBN, RAD51C or TP53 variants. In the high-risk group 5.8% women carried MUTYH causative variants, 2.5% had causative variants in ATM, 1.7% patients had variants in BRCA2 and 0.8% in BARD1, BRIP1 or CDH1. There was no significant difference in the presence of causative variants among clinical stages of breast cancer, tumor size and lymph nodes status. However, eight of the 12 BRCA1/2 causative variants were found in the TNBC group.

    "abstract": "Familial Colorectal Cancer Type X (FCCTX) is a type of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer in accordance to Amsterdam criteria-1 for Lynch syndrome, with no related mutation in mismatch repair gene. FCCTX is microsatellite stable and is accounted for 40% of families with Amsterdam criteria-1 with a high age of onset. Thus, the carcinogenesis of FCCTX is different compared to Lynch syndrome. In addition to the microsatellite stability and the presence of less predominant tumors in proximal colon, various clinical features have also been associated with FCCTX in comparison with Lynch syndrome such as no increased risk of extra-colonic cancers, older age of diagnosis and higher adenoma/carcinoma rate. Genetic etiology of this type of cancer which is autosomal dominant is unknown. In this review, we focus on the genes and their variants identified in this type of CRC. In order to find out the correlation between FCCTX and various genes database such as PubMed and PMC, search engine such as Google scholar and portals such as Springer and Elsevier have been searched. Based on our literature search, several studies suggest that FCCTX is a heterogeneous type of disease with different genetic variants. Recent studies describe the correlation between FCCTX and genes such as BRCA2, SEMA4, NTS, RASSF9, GALNT12, KRAS, BRAF, APC, BMPR1A, and RPS20. Considering the fact that BRCA2 has the highest mutation rate (60%) and is one of the most crucial DNA repair genes, it will be considered as a big role player in this type of cancer in comparison with other genes.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 25% of hereditary breast cancer cases are associated with a strong familial history which can be explained by mutations in BRCA1 orBRCA2 and other lower penetrance genes. The remaining high-risk families could be classified as BRCAX (non-BRCA1/2) families. Gene expression involving alternative splicing represents a well-known mechanism regulating the expression of multiple transcripts, which could be involved in cancer development. Thus using RNA-seq methodology, the analysis of transcriptome was undertaken to potentially reveal transcripts implicated in breast cancer susceptibility and development. RNA was extracted from immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines of 117 women (affected and unaffected) coming fromBRCA1,BRCA2 and BRCAX families. Anova analysis revealed a total of 95 transcripts corresponding to 85 different genes differentially expressed (Bonferroni corrected p-value <0.01) between those groups. Hierarchical clustering allowed distinctive subgrouping ofBRCA1/2 subgroups from BRCAX individuals. We found 67 transcripts, which could discriminate BRCAX fromBRCA1/BRCA2 individuals while 28 transcripts discriminate affected from unaffected BRCAX individuals. To our knowledge, this represents the first study identifying transcripts differentially expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines from major classes of mutation-related breast cancer subgroups, namelyBRCA1,BRCA2 and BRCAX. Moreover, some transcripts could discriminate affected from unaffected BRCAX individuals, which could represent potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "BRCA1 germline mutation is closely associated with triple-negative breast cancer. BRCA deficiency leads to impaired DNA repair and tumor development, and understanding this deficiency, in both hereditary and sporadic scenarios, is of great clinical and biological interest. Here, we investigated germline or somatic events that might lead to BRCA1 impairment in triple-negative breast cancer. We also analyzed the clinical implications associated with BRCA deficiency.                 Next-generation sequencing for the BRCA1/2 genes and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for the BRCA1 gene were performed for mutation screening. A customized bisulfite next-generation sequencing approach was used for assessing BRCA1 promoter methylation status in tumor tissue.                 A total of 131 triple-negative cases were assessed, and germline pathogenic variants were detected in 13.0% of all cases and in 26% of cases diagnosed in young women. Most germline pathogenic variants (88.2%) occurred in the BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was detected in 20.6% of tumors; none of these tumors were in BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers. BRCA1 impairment by either germline or somatic events was significantly more frequent in young women (55% in those ≤ 40 years; 33% in those 41-50 years; 22% in those > 50 years of age) and associated with better overall and disease-free survival rates in this group of patients.                 BRCA1 deficiency was recurrent in early-onset triple-negative breast cancer in Brazilian patients and associated with improved survival. With the new treatment modalities being investigated, including poly (ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy, our results suggest that a significant proportion of young women with this subtype of tumor might benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment, which warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Interpretation of genetic variation is needed for deciphering genotype-phenotype associations, mechanisms of inherited disease, and cancer driver mutations. Millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in human genomes are known and thousands are associated with disease. An estimated 21% of disease-associated amino acid substitutions corresponding to missense SNVs are located in protein sites of post-translational modifications (PTMs), chemical modifications of amino acids that extend protein function. ActiveDriverDB is a comprehensive human proteo-genomics database that annotates disease mutations and population variants through the lens of PTMs. We integrated >385,000 published PTM sites with ∼3.6 million substitutions from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the ClinVar database of disease genes, and human genome sequencing projects. The database includes site-specific interaction networks of proteins, upstream enzymes such as kinases, and drugs targeting these enzymes. We also predicted network-rewiring impact of mutations by analyzing gains and losses of kinase-bound sequence motifs. ActiveDriverDB provides detailed visualization, filtering, browsing and searching options for studying PTM-associated mutations. Users can upload mutation datasets interactively and use our application programming interface in pipelines. Integrative analysis of mutations and PTMs may help decipher molecular mechanisms of phenotypes and disease, as exemplified by case studies of TP53, BRCA2 and VHL.

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), which play a key role in DNA damage/repair pathways, have been developed as antitumor agents based on the concept of synthetic lethality. Synthetic lethality is the idea that cell death would be efficiently induced by simultaneous loss of function of plural key molecules, for example, by exposing tumor cells with inactivating gene mutation of BRCA-mediated DNA repair to chemically induced inhibition of PARPs. Indeed, three PARP inhibitors, olaparib, rucaparib and niraparib have already been approved in the US or Europe, mainly for the treatment of BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer. Clinical trials of various combinations of PARP inhibitors with cytotoxic or molecular-targeted agents are also underway. In particular, expanded applications of PARP inhibitors are anticipated following recent reports that defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR) are associated with mutations in repair genes other thanBRCA1/BRCA2, such asATM,ATR,PALB2,RAD51,CHEK1 andCHEK2, as well as with epigenetic loss ofBRCA1 function through promoter methylation or overexpression of the BRCA2-interacting transcriptional repressor EMSY. Current topics of interest include selection of the best agent in each clinical context, identification of new treatment targets for HRR-proficient cases, and development of PARP inhibitor-based regimens that are less toxic and that prolong overall survival as well as progression-free survival. In addition, potential long-term side effects and suitable biomarkers for predicting efficacy and mechanisms of clinical resistance are in discussion. This review summarizes representative preclinical and clinical data for PARP inhibitors and discusses their potential for future applications to treat various malignancies.",

In this study, we aimed to identify genetic alterations during the process of tumor clonal evolution and examine if ctDNA level well indicated clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and BC recurrence. We performed targeted ultra-deep sequencing of plasma DNAs, matched germline DNAs and tumor DNAs from locally advanced BC patients. Serial plasma DNAs were collected at diagnosis, after the 1st cycle of NAC and after curative surgery. For the target enrichment, we designed RNA baits covering a total of ∼202kb regions of the human genome including a total of 82 cancer-related genes. For ctDNA, 15 serial samples were collected and 87% of plasma SNVs were detected in 13 BC samples that had somatic alterations in tumor tissues. TheTP53 mutation was most commonly detected in primary tumor tissues and plasma followed byBRCA1 andBRCA2. At BC diagnosis, the amount of plasma SNVs did not correlate with clinical stage at diagnosis. With respect to the therapeutic effects of NAC, we found two samples in which ctDNA disappeared after the 1st NAC cycle achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR). In addition, the amount of ctDNA correlated with residual cancer volume detected by breast MRI. This targeted ultra-deep sequencing for ctDNA analysis would be useful for monitoring tumor burden and drug resistance. Most of all, we suggest that ctDNA could be the earliest predictor of NAC response.",

Two breast cancers were prospectively observed during 134 observation years (annual incidence rate 1.5% (95% CI 0.15% to 5.4%) and one additional breast cancer was diagnosed at first (prevalence) round.

We characterized the clinical profile of these individuals and explored the performance of international testing criteria.                 A pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant was detected in 19.1% of 418 probands, including seven novel frameshift variants. Variants of uncertain significance were found in 5.7% of individuals. We evaluated 50 testing criteria and mutation probability algorithms. There was a significant odds-ratio (OR) for mutation prediction (p ≤ 0.05) for 25 criteria; 14 of these had p ≤ 0.001. Using a cutoff point of four criteria, the sensitivity is 83.8%, and the specificity is 53.5% for being a carrier. The prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants for each criterion ranged from 22.1% to 55.6%, and criteria with the highest ORs were those related to triple-negative breast cancer or ovarian cancer.                 This is the largest study of comprehensive BRCA testing among Brazilians to date, and the first to analyze clinical criteria for genetic testing. Several criteria that are not included in the NCCN achieved a higher predictive value. Identification of the most informative criteria for each population will assist in the development of a rational approach to genetic testing, and will enable the prioritization of high-risk individuals as a first step towards offering testing in low-income countries.",

Each laboratory received the same tumor DNA samples ranging in genotype, quantity, quality, and variant allele frequency (VAF). Each laboratory performed their preferred next-generation sequencing method to report on the variants. No false positive results were reported in this small study and the majority of methods detected the low VAF variants. A number of variants were not detected due to the bioinformatics analysis, variant classification, or insufficient DNA.

Testing forBRCA mutations is a key step in the risk assessment, prognosis, treatment and prevention of OC and current clinical guidelines recommendBRCA mutation testing for all OCs of epithelial origin. Studies have established that ovarian tumors harboringBRCA mutations have distinct molecular and histo-pathological features that can be exploited for effective, targeted treatment. Deficiencies in DNA repair pathways that arise as a result of BRCA mutations make them hypersensitive to DNA-damaging treatments such as platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors.

    "abstract": "Purpose Guidelines are limited for genetic testing for prostate cancer (PCA). The goal of this conference was to develop an expert consensus-driven working framework for comprehensive genetic evaluation of inherited PCA in the multigene testing era addressing genetic counseling, testing, and genetically informed management. Methods An expert consensus conference was convened including key stakeholders to address genetic counseling and testing, PCA screening, and management informed by evidence review. Results Consensus was strong that patients should engage in shared decision making for genetic testing. There was strong consensus to test HOXB13 for suspected hereditary PCA, BRCA1/2 for suspected hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and DNA mismatch repair genes for suspected Lynch syndrome. There was strong consensus to factor BRCA2 mutations into PCA screening discussions. BRCA2 achieved moderate consensus for factoring into early-stage management discussion, with stronger consensus in high-risk/advanced and metastatic setting. Agreement was moderate to test all men with metastatic castration-resistant PCA, regardless of family history, with stronger agreement to test BRCA1/2 and moderate agreement to test ATM to inform prognosis and targeted therapy. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive, multidisciplinary consensus statement to address a genetic evaluation framework for inherited PCA in the multigene testing era. Future research should focus on developing a working definition of familial PCA for clinical genetic testing, expanding understanding of genetic contribution to aggressive PCA, exploring clinical use of genetic testing for PCA management, genetic testing of African American males, and addressing the value framework of genetic evaluation and testing men at risk for PCA-a clinically heterogeneous disease.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate unclassified variants (UVs) in BRCA1 and 2 of Korean patients with ovarian cancer.                 We retrospectively analyzed 138 patients diagnosed with ovarian/fallopian tubal/peritoneal cancer between January 2013 and January 2016, whose BRCA genetic test results and clinical characteristics were available for review. Patient peripheral blood lymphocyte specimens were assessed for BRCA mutations and variations by direct sequencing. Identified UVs were classified according to several algorithms.                 The results of genetic testing revealed 31 (22.5%, 31/138) pathogenic BRCA mutations (24 BRCA1, 7 BRCA2 mutations). The BRCA1 c.390C>A mutation was observed in 4 patients (12.9%, 4/31). Thirty-four (24.6%, 34/138) BRCA UVs were identified in 33 patients. Of these, the BRCA1 c.4883T>C and BRCA2 c.8187G>T variants were each detected in 4 patients (4/34, 11.8%). According to the used algorithms and cosegregation test, the BRCA1 c.5339T>C and BRCA2 c.8437_8439delGGA variants were both predicted to be likely pathogenic.                 The 2 identified likely pathogenic UVs require further verification with clinical evidence. Clarifying the clinical significance of UVs is an increasingly important step for cancer treatment in the current era of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 25% of patients with ovarian cancer harbor a pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation that has been associated with favorable responses for targeted therapy with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors compared to wild-type individuals. The overall frequency of germline and somaticBRCA1/2 alterations is estimated at 13-15% and 3-10%, respectively. A high incidence ofBRCA1/2 somatic variants significantly increases the number of patients eligible for treatment with PARP1 inhibitors. Here, we assessed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from 121 patients with ovarian cancer forBRCA1/2 mutational analysis by next generation sequencing. A total number of patients carrying the pathogenicBRCA1/2 variants was 30/121 (24.8%), including 22 and 7 individuals with exclusively germline or somatic mutations, respectively and one patient with variants of both origin. Among this cohort, more than one known pathogenicBRCA1 and/orBRCA2 alterations were identified in 7/30 individuals. The most recurrent mutations were detected in theBRCA1 gene: c.5266dupC (p.Gln1756Profs*74) with the frequency of ~18%, followed by c.3756_3759del (p.Ser1253Argfs*10) and c.181T>G (p.Cys61Gly). In seven (5.8%) patients, coincidence of two or moreBRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations have been identified. Our results clearly demonstrate that the detection of both germline and somaticBRCA1/2 mutations in ctDNA from ovarian cancer patients is feasible and may be a valuable complementary tool for identification of somatic alterations when the standard diagnostic procedures are insufficient. Finally, ctDNA can potentially allow to monitor the efficacy of PARP1 inhibitors and to detect a secondary reversionBRCA1/2 mutations.",

Overall 87 male carriers and 43 non-carriers aged 40-70 were prospectively enrolled. Clinical data were collected and all patients were tested for total testosterone (TT), prostate specific antigen (PSA), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), free androgen index (FAI), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and prolactin. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to predict TT levels.                 The median age, mean BMI, comorbidities, PSA, FSH, LH and SHBG levels in both groups were similar. However, mean TT and FAI were higher in the carriers (16.7 nmol/l vs 13.5 nmol/l, p=0.03 and 39.5 vs 34.8, p=0.05, respectively), while prolactin was significantly lower. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that while BMI was inversely correlated to TT levels in both groups, LH was a predictor only in non-carriers.                 Carriers have higher TT and FAI levels and lower prolactin levels; but LH does not predict their TT levels.

We set out to assess the rate of intrapatient radiological differential responses (RDR) to PARP inhibitors, its correlation with patient outcomes, and the identification of factors associated with RDR. We retrospectively reviewed all patients with advanced cancers from five early phase PARP inhibitor monotherapy trials. 113 patients (ovarian cancers 57.5%; breast cancers 23.9%) were included in this retrospective study; 46 (40.7%) patients developed RDR on PARP inhibitor monotherapy. We identified two patterns of RDR: early RDR (1st or 2nd on-treatment scans) in 69.6% of patients, and late RDR (penultimate or final scans) in 30.4% of patients. Early RDR was associated with shorter time to progression (TTP) (225 vs 367 days, HR:0.59, 95%CI 0.36-0.98; p=0.04) and overall survival (OS) (499 vs 857 days; HR:0.47, 95%CI 0.27-0.82, p=0.006). Seventy-nine (69.9%) patients had known germlineBRCA1/2 mutations; 49.4% of theseBRCA1/2 mutation carriers developed RDR versus 20.6% of patients with unknown or wildtypeBRCA1/2 status. Harboring germlineBRCA1/2 mutations was independently predictive for RDR (RR:2.93, 95% CI 1.08-7.90, p=0.03). Patients with germlineBRCA1 mutations had worse TTP and OS thanBRCA2 mutation carriers (212 vs 406 days, HR:0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.94, p=0.023 and 515 vs 937 days; HR:0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.83; p=0.007). RDR with PARP inhibitors are frequent, particularly in germlineBRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

There is a paucity of such mutational information for Asians. Panel testing of 25 cancer susceptibility genes and BRCA1/2 deletion/duplication analysis was performed for 220 Asian breast cancer patients or their family members referred for genetics risk assessment. All 220 participants had at least one high-risk feature: having a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in first- and/or second-degree relatives; having breast and ovarian cancer in the same individual or bilateral breast cancer; having early-onset breast cancer or ovarian cancer (⩽40 years of age). We identified 67 pathogenic variants in 66 (30.0%) patients. Of these, 19 (28.3%) occurred inBRCA1, 16 (23.9%) inBRCA2, 7 (10.4%) inPALB2, 6 (9.0%) inTP53, 2 (3.0%) inPTEN, 2 (3.0%) inCDH1 and 15 (22.4%) in other predisposition genes. Notably, 47.8% of pathogenic variants were in non-BRCA1/2 genes. Of the 66 patients with pathogenic mutations, 63.6% (42/66) were under the age of 40 years. Family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer is enriched in patients withBRCA1/2 pathogenic variants but less predictive for non-BRCA1/2 related pathogenic variations. We detected a median of three variants of unknown significance (VUS) per gene (range 0-21). Custom gene panel testing is feasible and useful for the detection of pathogenic mutations and should be done in the setting of a formal clinical cancer genetics service given the rate of VUS.",

Using data from 1769 patients from seven cancer types (bladder, glioblastoma, low-grade glioma, lung, melanoma, stomach, and pediatric glioma), we show that \"somatic-like\" germline variants are enriched for autosomal-dominant cancer-predisposition genes (p < 4.35 × 10-15), includingTP53. Our framework identifies germline and somatic nonsense variants inBRCA2 and other Fanconi anemia genes in 11% (11/100) of bladder cancer cases, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition in these patients. The bladder carcinoma patients with Fanconi anemia nonsense variants display aBRCA-deficiency somatic mutation signature, suggesting treatment targeted to DNA repair.",

Learning algorithms like Adaboost and Random Forest outperformed the classical tools. Further validations are warranted prior to implementation of these novel tools in clinical settings. Additionally, we report here for the first time activated cryptic donor sites in the large exon 11 of BRCA2 by evaluating the effect at the cDNA level of a novel tandem duplication (5' breakpoint in intron 4; 3' breakpoint in exon 11) and of a variant disrupting the splice donor site of exon 11 (c.6841+1G > C). Additional sites were predicted, but not activated. These sites warrant further research to increase our knowledge on cis and trans acting factors involved in the conservation of correct transcription of this large exon.

Even though patients with the most lethal form of the disease (HGSOC; high grade serous ovarian cancer) respond well to initial treatment, they often relapse with progressively resistant disease. Inhibitors of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes are a relatively new class of molecularly targeted small molecule drugs that show promise in overcoming resistance. The present study explores the combination of a DNA damaging agent, doxorubicin (DOX), with the PARP inhibitor, olaparib (OLP), in order to achieve optimal synergy of both drugs in serous ovarian cancer. This drug combination was evaluated and optimized in 2D monolayers and 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) using a genetically and histologically characterized panel of nine OC cell lines with or without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Combination index (CI) values of DOX and OLP were determined using the Chou and Talalay method. The potency of this drug combination was found to rely heavily on the molar ratios at which the two drugs are combined. In general, MCTS growth inhibition was reflective of the patterns predicted by the CI values obtained in monolayers. Promising combination ratios identified in this study warrant further preclinical and clinical investigation.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) in men is a rare disease, whose etiology appears to be associated with genetic factors. Inherited mutations in BRCA1/2 genes account for about 10-15% of all cases. FANCM, functionally linked to BRCA1/2, has been suggested as a novel BC susceptibility gene. Our aim was to test if FANCM germline mutations could further explain male BC (MBC) susceptibility.                 We screened the entire coding region of FANCM in 286 MBCs by a multi-gene panel analysis, and compared these data with available whole exome sequencing data from 415 men used as population controls. Moreover, we genotyped the two most frequent FANCM mutations (c.5101C>T and c.5791C>T) in 506 MBCs and 854 healthy male controls.                 Two FANCM truncating mutations, the c.1432C>T (p.Arg478Ter) and c.1972C>T (p.Arg658Ter), were identified in two MBC cases (0.7%). When specifically considering cases at increased genetic risk for BC, FANCM mutation frequency raises up to 1%. One mutation, the c.2201_2202delCT (p.Ser734Terfs), was found among controls (0.24%). Mutation frequency in cases was higher than in controls, however this difference was not statistically significant. FANCM c.5101C>T was not present in any of the cases and controls analyzed, whereas FANCM c.5791C>T was found in two controls (0.23%).                 Rare FANCM truncating mutations, other than c.5101C>T and c.5791C>T, may have a role in MBC susceptibility. The inclusion of FANCM in gene panels for research purpose would allow for the identification of a higher number of mutation carriers, thus helping estimate BC risk associated with FANCM mutations.",

Cost-effectiveness analyses of BRCA testing have not previously been performed at these lower BRCA prevalence levels seen in the Sephardi Jewish population. Here we present a cost-effectiveness analysis for UK and US populations comparing population testing with clinical criteria/family history-based testing in Sephardi Jewish women.                 A Markov model was built comparing the lifetime costs and effects of population-based BRCA1 testing, with testing using family history-based clinical criteria in Sephardi Jewish women aged ≥30 years. BRCA1 carriers identified were offered magnetic resonance imaging/mammograms and risk-reducing surgery. Costs are reported at 2015 prices. Outcomes include breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and excess deaths from heart disease. All costs and outcomes are discounted at 3.5%. The time horizon is lifetime, and perspective is payer. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year was calculated. Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.                 Population testing resulted in gain in life expectancy of 12 months (quality-adjusted life-year = 1.00). The baseline discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for UK population-based testing was £67.04/quality-adjusted life-year and for US population was $308.42/quality-adjusted life-year. Results were robust in the 1-way sensitivity analysis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 100% of simulations were cost effective at £20,000/quality-adjusted life-year UK and the $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year US willingness-to-pay thresholds. Scenario analysis showed that population testing remains cost effective in UK and US populations, even if premenopausal oophorectomy does not reduce breast cancer risk or if hormone replacement therapy compliance is nil.                 Population-based BRCA1 testing is highly cost effective compared with clinical criteria-driven approach in Sephardi Jewish women. This supports changing the paradigm to population-based BRCA testing in the Jewish population, regardless of Ashkenazi/Sephardi ancestry.",

    "abstract": "We conducted this study to identify genetic variants in cancer-related pathway genes which can predict prognosis of NSCLC patients after surgery, using a comprehensive list of regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) prioritized by RegulomeDB.                 A total of 509 potentially functional SNPs in cancer-related pathway genes selected from RegulomeDB were evaluated. These SNPs were analyzed in a discovery set (n=354), and a replication study was performed in an independent set (n=772). The association of the SNPs with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed.                 In the discovery set, 76 SNPs were significantly associated with OS or DFS. Among the 76 SNPs, the association was consistently observed for 5 SNPs (ERCC1 rs2298881C>A, BRCA2 rs3092989G>A, NELFE rs440454C>T, PPP2R4 rs2541164G>A, and LTBP4 rs3786527G>A) in the validation set. In combined analysis, ERCC1 rs2298881C>A, BRCA2 rs3092989, NELFE rs440454C>T, and PPP2R4 rs2541164G>A were significantly associated with OS and DFS (adjusted HR ·aHR· for OS=1.46, 0.62, 078, and 0.76, respectively; P=0.003, 0.002, 0.007, and 0.003 respectively; and aHR for DFS=1.27, 0.69, 0.86, and 0.82, respectively; P=0.02, 0.002, 0.03, and 0.008, respectively). The LTBP4 rs3786527G>A was significantly associated with better OS (aHR=0.75; P=0.003).

    "abstract": "BRCA1 Associated RING Domain 1 (BARD1) encodes a protein which interacts with the N-terminal region of BRCA1 in vivo and in vitro. The full length (FL) BARD1 mRNA includes 11 exons and encodes a protein comprising of six domains (N-terminal RING-finger domain, three Ankyrin repeats and two C-terminal BRCT domains) with different functions. Emerging data suggest that BARD1 can have both tumor-suppressor gene and oncogene functions in tumor initiation and progression. Indeed, whereas FL BARD1 protein acts as tumor-suppressor with and without BRCA1 interactions, aberrant splice variants of BARD1 have been detected in various cancers and have been shown to play an oncogenic role. Further evidence for a dualistic role came with the identification of BARD1 as a neuroblastoma predisposition gene in our genome wide association study which has demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in BARD1 can correlate with risk or can protect against cancer based on their association with the expression of FL and splice variants of BARD1. This review is an overview of how BARD1 functions in tumorigenesis with opposite effects in various types of cancer.",

We searched the database of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC) for changes in classification of genetic variants as an update to our earlier publication on genetic variants in the Centre of Dresden. Changes between 2015 and 2017 were recorded.

In BRCA1, 25% of the Class 3 variants (n = 2/8) changed to Class 2 (likely benign) and Class 1 (benign). In BRCA2, in 50% of the Class 3 variants (n = 16/32), a change to Class 2 (n = 10/16) or Class 1 (n = 6/16) was observed. No change in classification was noted in Class 4 (likely pathogenic) and Class 5 (pathogenic) genetic variants in both genes. No up-staging from Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3 to more clinical significance was observed.

The prognostic significance of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations on survival is not well established.                 We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations in resected sporadic PDAC cases from 2000 to 2015. Germline BRCA mutation carriers were matched by age and tumor location to those with BRCA1/BRCA2 wild-type genes from our institutional database. Demographics, clinicopathologic features, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were abstracted from medical records and compared between the 2 cohorts.                 Twenty-two patients with sporadic cancer and BRCA1 (n = 4) or BRCA2 (n = 18) germline mutations and 105 wild-type patients were identified for this case-control study. The BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were associated with inferior median OS (20.2 vs 27.8 months, p = 0.034) and DFS (8.4 vs 16.7 months, p < 0.001) when compared with the matched wild-type controls. On multivariable analyses, a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation (hazard ratio [HR] 2.10, p < 0.001), positive margin status (HR 1.72, p = 0.021), and lack of adjuvant therapy (HR 2.38, p < 0.001), were all independently associated with worse survival. Within the BRCA1/BRCA2 mutated group, having had platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 10) was associated with better survival than alternative chemotherapy (n = 8) or no adjuvant therapy (n = 4) (31.0 vs 17.8 vs 9.3 months, respectively, p < 0.001).                 Carriers of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation with sporadic PDAC had a worse survival after pancreatectomy than their BRCA wild-type counterparts. However, platinum-based chemotherapy regimens were associated with markedly improved survival in patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, with survival differences no longer appreciated with wild-type patients.",

Sensitive and accurate detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is crucial for personalized clinical management of individuals affected by breast or ovarian cancer, and for the identification of at-risk healthy relatives. We performed molecular analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 898 Greek families, using Sanger sequencing or Next Generation Sequencing for the detection of small insertion/deletion frameshift, nonsynonymous, truncating and splice-site alterations and MLPA for the detection of large genomic rearrangements. In total, a pathogenic mutation was identified in 12.9% of 898 families analyzed. Of the 116 mutations identified in total 9% were novel and 14.7% were large genomic rearrangements. Our results indicate that different types of mutational events in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for the hereditary component of breast/ovarian cancer in the Greek population. Therefore the methodology used in the analysis of Greek patients must be able to detect both point and small frameshift mutations in addition to large genomic rearrangements across the entire coding region of the two genes.",

A total of 26 pathogenic mutations were observed in 49 unrelated BC patients (49/313, 15.7%). BRCA2 mutations (27/49, 55.1%) were more common than BRCA1 mutations (22/49, 44.9%). We identified five novel point mutations, one in BRCA1 (c.4352_4356delA) and four in BRCA2 (c.151G>T, c.4707_4708delCA, c.7811_7814delTGTG, and c.9304_9305delG), as well as two novel deletions involving parts of the BRCA1 gene (c.81-?_593+?del and c.5470-?_5530+?del).

Multiple-gene sequencing has already entered clinical practice for female breast cancer, whereas the performance of panel testing in MBC has not been studied extensively. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of panel testing for MBC, by the largest gene panel used so far, through investigation of patients deriving from a population with known founder effects.                 Genomic DNA from one hundred and two Greek MBC patients, unselected for age and family history, was used to prepare libraries which capture the entire coding regions of 94 cancer genes.                 Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations were found in 12.7% of the cases, distributed in six genes: BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, CHEK2, PMS2, and FANCL. BRCA2 mutations were the most frequent, followed by ATM mutations, accounting for 6.9 and 2%, respectively, while mutations in other genes were detected in single cases. Age at diagnosis or family history was not predictive of mutation status. Beyond mutations in established breast cancer predisposing genes, LoF mutations in PMS2 and FANCL among MBC patients are reported here for the first time.                 Our findings, using the largest gene panel for MBC patients so far, indicate that BRCA testing should be the primary concern for MBC patients. Until sufficient evidence arises from larger studies, multiple-gene panels may be of limited benefit for MBC and their families, at least for MBC patients of specific descent.",

The nearly universal loss of normal p53 regulation in HGSOCs causes dysfunction in the G1/S checkpoint, making tumor cells reliant on Chk1-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest for DNA repair. Therefore, Chk1 is a reasonable target for a combination strategy with PARPi in treatingBRCA wild type HGSOC. Here we investigated the combination of prexasertib mesylate monohydrate (LY2606368), a Chk1 and Chk2 inhibitor, and a PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in HGSOC cell lines (OVCAR3, OV90, PEO1 and PEO4) using clinically attainable concentrations. Our findings showed combination treatment synergistically decreased cell viability in all cell lines and induced greater DNA damage and apoptosis than the control and/or monotherapies (p<0.05). Treatment with olaparib inBRCA wild type HGSOC cells caused formation of Rad51 foci, whereas the combination treatment with prexasertib inhibited transnuclear localization of Rad51, a key protein in homologous recombination repair. Overall, our data provide evidence that prexasertib and olaparib combination resulted in synergistic cytotoxic effects againstBRCA wild type HGSOC cells through reduced Rad51 foci formation and greater induction of apoptosis. This may be a novel therapeutic strategy for HGSOC.",

TheBRCA2 p.Lys3326Ter (K3326X) (rs11571833) mutation identified in our patient is a debated substitution of thymidine for adenine which is currently regarded as benign polymorphism in main gene databases. Recent studies, however, describe this variant as associated with breast and ovarian tumors. Based on the observation of the cancer's earliest age of onset in this subject, our purpose was to reevaluate this variant according to recent papers indicating a role of powerful modifier of the genetic penetrance. Genetic testing was performed in all consenting patient's relatives, and in the collection of the clinical data particular attention was paid to the age of onset of the neoplasia. Following our observation that the our patient with double heterozygosis had an early age of onset for cancer similar to a few rare cases of double mutation forBRCA1 andBRCA2, we also performed an extensive review of the literature relative to patients carrying a double heterozygosity for both genes. In line with previous studies relative to the rare double heterozygosity in bothBRCA1/2 genes, we found the earlier onset of breast cancer in our patient with bothBRCA1/2 mutations with respect to other relatives carrying the singleBRCA1 mutation. The presence of the second K3326X variant in our case induces a phenotype characterized by early onset of the neoplasia in a manner similar to the other cases of double heterozygosity previously described. Therefore, we suggest that during the genetic counseling, it should be recommendable to evaluate the presence of the K3326X variant in association with other pathogenic mutations.",

Carriers ofBRCA1/2 or any other tested gene pathogenic variants were more likely to be diagnosed younger, have first or second-degree relatives with OC, and have OC classified as high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). After adjustment for these variables, all 3 features were independent predictive factors for pathogenic variants in any tested genes whereas only the latter two remained for variants inBRCA1/2. Our data indicate similar variant prevalence in Japanese patients with OC and other ethnic groups and suggest that HGSC and OC family history may facilitate genetic predisposition prediction in Japanese patients with OC and referring high-risk patients for genetic counseling and testing.",

There was only one carrier of the GG genotype. This individual did not have personal or family history of cancer and did not meet the National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for hereditary cancer genetic testing.                 Although previous work has demonstrated that the BRCA2 c.6937 + 594T>G variant affects splicing, this association study does not support a pathogenic role for the BRCA2 c.6937 + 594T>G intronic variant in breast and ovarian cancer syndrome susceptibility. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need to take into account multiple diverse populations in association studies for the assessment of variant pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are clinically and pathologically heterogeneous and respond poorly to treatment. Genomic profiling can offer a clearer understanding of their carcinogenesis, classification and treatment strategy. We performed large-scale genome sequencing analyses on BTCs to investigate their somatic and germline driver events and characterize their genomic landscape.                 We analyzed 412 BTC samples from Japanese and Italian populations, 107 by whole-exome sequencing (WES), 39 by whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and a further 266 samples by targeted sequencing. The subtypes were 136 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs), 101 distal cholangiocarcinomas (DCCs), 109 peri-hilar type cholangiocarcinomas (PHCs), and 66 gallbladder or cystic duct cancers (GBCs/CDCs). We identified somatic alterations and searched for driver genes in BTCs, finding pathogenic germline variants of cancer-predisposing genes. We predicted cell-of-origin for BTCs by combining somatic mutation patterns and epigenetic features.                 We identified 32 significantly and commonly mutated genes including TP53, KRAS, SMAD4, NF1, ARID1A, PBRM1, and ATR, some of which negatively affected patient prognosis. A novel deletion of MUC17 at 7q22.1 affected patient prognosis. Cell-of-origin predictions using WGS and epigenetic features suggest hepatocyte-origin of hepatitis-related ICCs. Deleterious germline mutations of cancer-predisposing genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51D, MLH1, or MSH2 were detected in 11% (16/146) of BTC patients.                 BTCs have distinct genetic features including somatic events and germline predisposition. These findings could be useful to establish treatment and diagnostic strategies for BTCs based on genetic information.

We aimed to define pathological and clinical characteristics associated with germline DNA-repair gene mutations, to facilitate selection of patients for germline testing.                 We retrospectively evaluated 150 unselected patients with recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer who were offered germline genetic testing by a single oncologist using a clinical-grade assay (Color Genomics). This platform utilizes next-generation sequencing from saliva to interrogate 30 cancer-susceptibility genes. Presence or absence of a deleterious germline mutation was correlated with histological and clinical characteristics, and with family history of cancer. All patients with DNA-sequence alterations (pathogenic or variants) were offered genetic counseling.                 Between July 2016 and July 2017, 150 consecutive patients underwent germline testing; pathogenic mutations were identified in 21 men (14%). Among those with germline mutations, 9 (43%) were in BRCA2, 3 (14%) were in ATM, 3 (14%) were in CHEK2, and 2 (9%) were in BRCA1. While there were no associations between germline mutations and age, tumor stage, Gleason sum or family history; mutation-positive patients had lower median PSA levels at diagnosis (5.5 vs 8.6 ng/mL, P = 0.01) and unique pathologic features. Namely, men with germline mutations were more likely to harbor intraductal/ductal histology (48% vs 12%, P < 0.01) and lymphovascular invasion (52% vs 14%, P < 0.01). Finally, 44% of patients with a positive germline test would not have been offered genetic screening according to current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.                 Presence of intraductal/ductal histology and lymphovascular invasion appear to be associated with pathogenic germline DNA-repair gene mutations in men with prostate cancer, and identification of these features may help to select patients for germline testing. NCCN guidelines may be inadequate in predicting which prostate cancer patients should undergo genetic screening.",

Of them, 222 nucleotide sequence modifications in DNA located in exons and splice sites of 203 genes were selected. On the basis of the function of these genes in the cell and their involvement in carcinogenesis, 40 novel candidate genes were selected. These genes are involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, apoptosis, regulation of cell invasion, proliferation and growth, transcription, and also immune response and might be involved in development of ovarian cancer.",

These families may have additional genetic variants, which not only may increase the susceptibility of the families'path_BRCA1/2, but also be capable of causing cancer in the absence of thepath_BRCA1/2 variants. We aimed to identify novel genetic variants in prospectively detected breast cancer (BC) or gynecological cancer cases tested negative for their families' pathogenicBRCA1/2 variant (path_BRCA1 orpath_BRCA2).                 Women with BC or gynecological cancer who had tested negative for path_BRCA1 orpath_BRCA2 variants were included. Forty-four cancer susceptibility genes were screened for genetic variation through a targeted amplicon-based sequencing assay. Protein- and RNA splicing-dedicated in silico analyses were performed for all variants of unknown significance (VUS). Variants predicted as the ones most likely affecting pre-mRNA splicing were experimentally analyzed in a minigene assay.                 We identified 48 women who were tested negative for their family's path_BRCA1 (n = 13) orpath_BRCA2 (n = 35) variants.

Therefore, there is a growing demand for the development of accurate, rapid assay systems that simultaneously detect pathogenic variants and copy number alterations. Here, we tested Thermo Fisher Scientific's newly developed Oncomine®BRCA1/2 Panel. We showed that all mutations in standard reference DNA were detected with high accuracy, and that values of allelic fractions were detected with high concordance (R2 = 0.9986). The Oncomine®BRCA1/2 Panel detected 21 pathogenic germline variants in 147 patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer, of which 20 were detected by the previously-launched Ion AmpliSeq™BRCA1/2 Panel, except for one frameshift mutation. The Oncomine®BRCA1/2 Panel precisely captured one additional frameshift mutation, which is difficult to detect because of the homopolymer site. Large genomic deletion was identified in one sample, which was previously detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Oncomine®BRCA1/2 Panel could accurately detect pathogenic variant and copy number alteration, and be an alternative assay to investigateBRCA1/2 germline and somatic mutations.",

    "abstract": "Background: Germline mutations in thePALB2 gene are associated with the genetic disorder Fanconi anaemia and increased predisposition to cancer. Disease-associated variants are mainly protein-truncating mutations, whereas a few missense substitutions are reported to perturb its interaction with breast cancer susceptibility proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2, which play essential roles in homology-directed repair (HDR). More recently, PALB2 was shown to associate with active genes independently of BRCA1, and through this mechanism, safeguards these regions from DNA replicative stresses. However, it is unknown whether PALB2 tumour suppressor function requires its chromatin association.Methods: Mining the public database of cancer mutations, we identified four potentially deleterious cancer-associated missense mutations within the PALB2 chromatin association motif (ChAM). To assess the impact of these mutations on PALB2 function, we generated cell lines expressing PALB2 variants harbouring corresponding ChAM mutations, and evaluated PALB2 chromatin association properties and the cellular resistance to camptothecin (CPT). Additionally, we examined the accumulation of γH2A.X and the RAD51 recombinase as readouts of DNA damage signalling and HDR, respectively.Results: We demonstrate that a small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)-associated T413S mutation in PALB2 impairs its chromatin association and confers reduced resistance to CPT, the only FDA-approved drug for relapsed SCLC. Unexpectedly, we found a less efficient γH2A.X nuclear foci formation in PALB2 T413S expressing cells, whereas a near-normal level of RAD51 nuclear foci was visible.Conclusions: These findings support the importance of PALB2 chromatin association in the suppression of tumours, including SCLC, an unusually aggressive type of cancer with poor prognosis. PALB2 T413S has little impact on RAD51 recruitment, likely due to its intact interaction with BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, this mutant shows inefficient DNA stress signalling. This finding sheds new light on the function of PALB2, playing a role in efficient DNA stress signalling through constitutive chromatin association.",

We have developed unique patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from metastatic lesions of germline BRCA-mutated patients obtained at distinct time points; before treatment and at progression. Thus, closely mimicking clinical scenarios, to further investigate treatment naïve and resistant patients. DNA was isolated from six BRCA-mutated PDXs and classified by whole-genome sequencing to stable-genome or homologous recombination deficient (HRD)-genome. The sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents was evaluated in vivo in three BRCA-associated PDAC PDXs models: (1) HRD-genome naïve to treatments; (2) stable-genome naïve to treatment; (3) HRD-genome resistant to treatment. Correlation between disease course at tissue acquisition and response to PARP inhibitor (PARPi)/platinum was demonstrated in PDXs in vivo. Only the HRD-genome PDX, naïve to treatment, was sensitive to PARP inhibitor/cisplatin treatments. Our results demonstrate heterogeneous responses to DNA damaging agents/PARPi in BRCA-associated PDX thus reflecting the wide clinical spectrum. An HRD-genome PDX generated from a naïve to treatment biopsy was sensitive to platinum/PARPi whereas no benefit was observed in treating a HRD-genome PDXs generated from a patient that had acquired resistance nor stable-genome PDXs.",

With a median age of 50 years at diagnosis, a higher prevalence of hereditary breast cancer may be expected.

Jordanian breast cancer women with a selected high risk profile were invited to participate. Peripheral blood samples were obtained for DNA extraction. A detailed 3-generation family history was also collected. BRCA sequencing was performed at a reference laboratory. Mutations were classified as deleterious, suspected deleterious, variant of uncertain significance or favor polymorphisms. Patients' medical records were reviewed for extraction of clinical and tumor pathology data.                 One hundred patients were enrolled to the study. Median age was 40 (22-75) years. In total, 20 patients had deleterious and 7 suspected deleterious mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Seven variants of uncertain significance were also detected. After excluding patients tested subsequent to the index case in their families, highest mutation rates were observed among triple negatives (9/16, 56.3%) especially among those with positive family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer (9/13, 69.2%), patients with bilateral or second primary breast cancer (10/15, 66.7%) and those with family history of male breast cancer (2/5, 40.0%).                 BRCA1/2 mutations are not uncommon among selected Jordanian females with breast cancer. The contribution of these findings to much younger age at diagnosis is debatable. Although small, our selected patient cohort shows an important incidence of deleterious and suspected deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations suggesting that genetic testing should be offered to patients with certain high risk features.",

Here, we report the use of an insertional mutagenesis screen to identify a role for BRE (Brain and Reproductive organ Expressed, also known as BRCC45), known to be a part of the BRCA1-DNA damage sensing complex, in the survival of BRCA2-deficient mouse ES cells. Cell viability by BRE overexpression is mediated by deregulation of CDC25A phosphatase, a key cell cycle regulator and an oncogene. We show that BRE facilitates deubiquitylation of CDC25A by recruiting ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 7 (USP7) in the presence of DNA damage. Additionally, we uncovered the role of CDC25A in BRCA-mediated tumorigenesis, which can have implications in cancer treatment.",

Commercial analysis of the BRCA1/2 genes has been available since 1996, and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is well established. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines identify individuals for whom BRCA1/2 analysis is appropriate and define management recommendations for mutation carriers. Despite recommendations, not all who meet NCCN criteria undergo genetic testing. We assess the frequency that individuals meeting NCCN criteria decline BRCA1/2 analysis, as well as factors that affect the decision-making process. A retrospective chart review was performed from September 2013 through August 2014 of individuals who received genetic counseling at the Levine Cancer Institute. A total of 1082 individuals identified through the retrospective chart review met NCCN criteria for BRCA1/2 analysis. Of these, 267 (24.7%) did not pursue genetic testing. Of the Nontested cohort, 59 (22.1%) were disinterested in testing and 108 (40.4%) were advised to gather additional genetic or medical information about their relatives before testing. The remaining 100 (37.5%) individuals were insured and desired to undergo genetic testing but were prohibited by the expense. Eighty five of these 100 patients were responsible for the total cost of the test, whereas the remaining 15 faced a prohibitive copay expense. Financial concerns are a major deterrent to the pursuit of BRCA1/2 analysis among those who meet NCNN criteria, especially in patients diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. These findings highlight the need to address financial concerns for genetic testing in this high-risk population.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to report specific harmful BRCA1/2 mutations in the Chinese population and discuss the clinicopathological features in mutation carriers. BRCA1/2 germline mutation tests for 71 patients with breast cancer from a hereditarily high-risk Chinese population were performed using next-generation sequencing for identification of deleterious mutations. Furthermore, the clinicopathological features between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and non-carriers were compared. A total of 13/71 (18.3%) patients carried a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (7 BRCA1 and 6 BRCA2). The incidence of BRCA1/2 mutation in patients with bilateral breast cancer and patients with family history were 25, and 32.2%, respectively. Eleven pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were identified in 13 patients, among the mutation sites 7 were never reported before in Asian populations. The age at diagnosis of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was older compared with non-mutation carriers (44.73 vs. 35.39 years; P=0.001) in this cohort. BRCA1/2 deleterious mutation carriers had a significantly lower chance of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2) positive status (P=0.010), higher tumor grade at diagnosis (P=0.009), higher probability to have a family history (P=0.016) and older age at diagnosis. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status were significantly different between BRCA1, and BRCA2 mutation carriers (P=0.007). The current interpretation of BRCA1/2 status can only explain a small part of hereditary high-risk breast cancer. However, BRCA1/2 gene testing should still be recommended for women with a family history of breast cancer, as well as patients with breast cancer with specific pathologic types, which may be useful to make appropriate clinical decisions for treatment and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Inherited DNA-repair gene mutations are more prevalent in men with advanced prostate cancer than previously thought, but their clinical implications are not fully understood.                 To investigate the clinical significance of germline DNA-repair gene alterations in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving next-generation hormonal therapy (NHT), with a particular emphasis on BRCA/ATM mutations.                 We interrogated 50 genes for pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations using leukocyte DNA from 172 mCRPC patients beginning treatment with first-line NHT with abiraterone or enzalutamide.                 We assessed the impact of germline DNA-repair gene mutation status on ≥50% and ≥90% PSA responses, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), clinical/radiologic progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Survival outcomes were adjusted using propensity score-weighted multivariable Cox regression analyses.                 Among 172 mCRPC patients included, germline mutations (in any DNA-repair gene) were found in 12% (22/172) of men, and germline BRCA/ATM mutations specifically in 5% (9/172) of men. In unadjusted analyses, outcomes to first-line NHT were better in men with germline BRCA/ATM mutations (vs no mutations) with respect to PSA-PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.47; p=0.061), PFS (HR 0.50; p=0.090), and OS (HR 0.28; p=0.059). In propensity score-weighted multivariable analyses, outcomes were superior in men with germline BRCA/ATM mutations with respect to PSA-PFS (HR 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.92; p=0.027), PFS (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.98; p=0.044), and OS (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.99; p=0.048), but not in men with non-BRCA/ATM germline mutations (all p>0.10). These results require prospective validation, and our conclusions are limited by the small number of patients (n=9) with BRCA/ATM mutations.                 Outcomes to first-line NHT appear better in mCRPC patients harboring germline BRCA/ATM mutations (vs no mutations), but not for patients with other non-BRCA/ATM germline mutations.                 Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and harboring germline mutations in BRCA1/2 and ATM benefit from treatment with abiraterone and enzalutamide.",

    "abstract": "Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) mutation carriers with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may benefit from precision therapies and their relatives should undergo tailored cancer prevention. In this study, we compared strategies to identify BRCA carriers with PDAC. Incident cases of PDAC were prospectively recruited for BRCA sequencing. Probands were evaluated using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) guidelines. The probability of each proband carrying a mutation was estimated by surveying genetic counselors and using BRCAPRO. BRCA mutations were detected in 22/484 (4.5%) probands. 152/484 (31.2%) and 16/484 (3.3%) probands met the NCCN and MOHLTC guidelines, respectively. The NCCN guidelines had higher sensitivity than the MOHLTC guidelines (0.864 versus 0.227, P < 0.001) but lower specificity (0.712 versus 0.976, P < 0.001). One hundred and nineteen genetic counselors completed the survey. Discrimination was similar between genetic counselors and BRCAPRO (area-under-the-curve: 0.755 and 0.775, respectively, P = 0.702). Genetic counselors generally overestimated (P = 0.008), whereas BRCAPRO severely underestimated (P < 0.001), the probability that each proband carried a mutation. Our results indicate that the NCCN guidelines and genetic counselors accurately identify BRCA mutations in PDAC, while the MOHLTC guidelines and BRCAPRO should be updated to account for the association between BRCA and PDAC.",

The Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) has assembled data on 18,435 families with BRCA1 mutations and 11,351 families with BRCA2 mutations ascertained from 69 centers in 49 countries on six continents. This study comprehensively describes the characteristics of the 1,650 unique BRCA1 and 1,731 unique BRCA2 deleterious (disease-associated) mutations identified in the CIMBA database. We observed substantial variation in mutation type and frequency by geographical region and race/ethnicity. In addition to known founder mutations, mutations of relatively high frequency were identified in specific racial/ethnic or geographic groups that may reflect founder mutations and which could be used in targeted (panel) first pass genotyping for specific populations. Knowledge of the population-specific mutational spectrum in BRCA1 and BRCA2 could inform efficient strategies for genetic testing and may justify a more broad-based oncogenetic testing in some populations.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen cancer emerge as one of the leading cause of mortality worldwide with breast cancer being the second most common cause of death among women. Individuals harboring BRCA mutations are at a higher risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancers. This risk is much greater in the presence of germline mutations. BRCA1 and BRCA2 play crucial role in the DNA damage response and repair pathway, a function that is critical in preserving the integrity of the genome. Mutations that interfere with normal cellular function of BRCA not only lead to onset and progression of cancer but also modulate therapy outcome of treatment with platinum drugs. In this review, we discuss the structural and functional impact of some of the prevalent BRCA mutations in breast and ovarian cancers and their role in platinum therapy response. Understanding the response of platinum drugs in the context of BRCA mutations may contribute toward developing better therapeutics that can improve survival and quality of life of patients.",

    "abstract": "Although the spliceogenic nature of the BRCA2 c.68-7T > A variant has been demonstrated, its association with cancer risk remains controversial. In this study, we accurately quantified by real-time PCR and digital PCR (dPCR), the BRCA2 isoforms retaining or missing exon 3. In addition, the combined odds ratio for causality of the variant was estimated using genetic and clinical data, and its associated cancer risk was estimated by case-control analysis in 83,636 individuals. Co-occurrence in trans with pathogenic BRCA2 variants was assessed in 5,382 families. Exon 3 exclusion rate was 4.5-fold higher in variant carriers (13%) than controls (3%), indicating an exclusion rate for the c.68-7T > A allele of approximately 20%. The posterior probability of pathogenicity was 7.44 × 10-115 . There was neither evidence for increased risk of breast cancer (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.86-1.24) nor for a deleterious effect of the variant when co-occurring with pathogenic variants. Our data provide for the first time robust evidence of the nonpathogenicity of the BRCA2 c.68-7T > A. Genetic and quantitative transcript analyses together inform the threshold for the ratio between functional and altered BRCA2 isoforms compatible with normal cell function. These findings might be exploited to assess the relevance for cancer risk of other BRCA2 spliceogenic variants.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm in women, with 5%-10% patients showing a familial predisposition, where germline mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 genes are found in -20% of cases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is among the best available options for genetic screening, providing several benefits that include enhanced sensitivity and unbiased mutation detection. PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2) is a cancer predisposing gene recently described that encodes a protein partner of BRCA2 involved in DNA double-strand break repair and cell cycle control. The DNA damage response represents a key cellular event, targeted by innovative anticancer therapies, including those based on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors targeting PARP1 and PARP2 enzymes, activated by DNA damage and involved in single-strand break and base excision repair.                 Genomic DNA was isolated from 34 patient samples and four BC cell lines, as controls, and 27 breast cancer predisposing genes belonging to the BRCA1/BRCA2 and PARP pathways were sequenced by NGS.                 The panel described here allowed identification of several sequence variations in most investigated genes, among which we found a novel truncating mutation in PALB2.                 The NGS-based strategy designed here for molecular analysis of a customized panel of BC predisposing and related genes was found to perform effectively, providing a comprehensive exploration of all genomic sequences of the investigated genes. It is thus useful for BC molecular diagnosis, in particular for familiar cases where alterations in routinely investigated genes, such as BRCAs, result to be absent.",

Data evaluated included personal cancer history, family history, frequency of genetic testing, frequency/type of genetic mutations, and frequency of surgical intervention. Standard statistical statistics were utilized.                 1227 patients were evaluated from 2003 to 2015, of which 95 (7.7%) were AA. Sixteen patients had a personal history of ovarian cancer. 21 women (22%) underwent genetic counseling only; subsequent genetic testing was not recommended based on absence of risk factors. Of the seventy-four AA patients in whom genetic testing was recommended, sixty-six (69.5%) completed testing. Of women tested, 37 (56%) had abnormal results. Eight and 14 patients had pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. Two were found to have pathogenic PALB2 variants; one had a pathogenic ATM variant and one constitutional MLH1 epimutation case was identified. Eleven had BRCA variants of uncertain significance. Of the patients with abnormal testing, six of 22 women with pathogenic BRCA variants underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO).                 Our study demonstrates that in a region where AAs represent 27% of the population, the proportion of AA patients referred to a Gynecologic Cancer Risk Assessment Clinic remains low. Pathogenic variant and variant of uncertain significance rates were high in patients tested, likely representing a selection bias of high-risk patients. Endeavors should continue to identify minorities at risk for ovarian cancer and institute measures to provide thorough genetic counseling and testing.",

    "abstract": "Carotid body tumor (CBT) is a form of head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) arising at the bifurcation of carotid arteries. Paragangliomas are commonly associated with germline and somatic mutations involving at least one of more than thirty causative genes. However, the specific functionality of a number of these genes involved in the formation of paragangliomas has not yet been fully investigated.                 Exome library preparation was carried out using Nextera® Rapid Capture Exome Kit (Illumina, USA). Sequencing was performed on NextSeq 500 System (Illumina).                 Exome analysis of 52 CBTs revealed potential driver mutations (PDMs) in 21 genes: ARNT, BAP1, BRAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, CSDE1, FGFR3, IDH1, KIF1B, KMT2D, MEN1, RET, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SETD2, TP53BP1, TP53BP2, and TP53I13. In many samples, more than one PDM was identified. There are also 41% of samples in which we did not identify any PDM; in these cases, the formation of CBT was probably caused by the cumulative effect of several not highly pathogenic mutations. Estimation of average mutation load demonstrated 6-8 mutations per megabase (Mb). Genes with the highest mutation rate were identified.                 Exome analysis of 52 CBTs for the first time revealed the average mutation load for these tumors and also identified potential driver mutations as well as their frequencies and co-occurrence with the other PDMs.",

    "abstract": "Identification of pathogenic germline alterations (PGAs) has important clinical and therapeutic implications in pancreas cancer. We performed comprehensive germline testing (GT) in an unselected prospective cohort of patients with exocrine pancreatic neoplasms with genotype and phenotype association to facilitate identification of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers and examine potential therapeutic implications.                 Six hundred fifteen unselected patients with exocrine pancreatic neoplasms were prospectively consented for somatic tumor and matched sample profiling for 410-468 genes. GT for PGAs in 76 genes associated with cancer susceptibility was performed in an \"identified\" manner in 356 (57.9%) patients and in an \"anonymized\" manner in 259 (42.1%) patients, using an institutional review board-approved protocol. Detailed clinical and pathological features, response to platinum, and overall survival (OS) were collected for the identified cohort. OS was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves.                 PGAs were present in 122 (19.8%) of 615 patients involving 24 different genes, including BRCA1/2, ATM, PALB2, and multiple additional genes associated with the DNA damage response pathway. Of 122 patients with germline alterations, 41.8% did not meet current guidelines for GT. The difference in median OS was not statistically significant between patients with and without PGA (50.8 months, 95% confidence interval = 34.5 to not reached, two-sided P = .94). Loss of heterozygosity was found in 60.0% of BRCA1/2.                 PGAs frequently occur in pancreas exocrine neoplasms and involve multiple genes beyond those previously associated with hereditary pancreatic cancer. These PGAs are therapeutically actionable in about 5% to 10% of patients. These data support routinely offering GT in all pancreatic ductal adenocarcimona patients with a broad panel of known hereditary cancer predisposition genes.",

    "abstract": "BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor that regulates DNA repair by homologous recombination. Germline mutations in BRCA1 are associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer and BRCA1 deficient tumors are exquisitely sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Therefore, uncovering additional components of this DNA repair pathway is of extreme importance for further understanding cancer development and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Here, we identify EDC4, a known component of processing-bodies and regulator of mRNA decapping, as a member of the BRCA1-BRIP1-TOPBP1 complex. EDC4 plays a key role in homologous recombination by stimulating end resection at double-strand breaks. EDC4 deficiency leads to genome instability and hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-linking drugs and PARP inhibitors. Lack-of-function mutations in EDC4 were detected in BRCA1/2-mutation-negative breast cancer cases, suggesting a role in breast cancer susceptibility. Collectively, this study recognizes EDC4 with a dual role in decapping and DNA repair whose inactivation phenocopies BRCA1 deficiency.",

    "abstract": "The canine BRCA2 is a tumor supressor gene which encodes the BRCA2 protein, involved in DNA repair through interaction with the RAD51 recombinase. This process is mediated by eigth BRC repeats that are encoded by BRCA2 exon 11. Two variants corresponding to human mutations in human BRC3 repeat have been reported in canine BRC3 repeat. In addition, other variants have also been described in canine BRCA2 exon 11. Considering the importance of polymorphisms in human BRCA2 to breast cancer development, this study aimed to investigate the frequency of variants in BRCA2 exon 11 in 48 blood and tissue DNA samples from bitches with canine mammary tumors (CMT), as well as, to analyze tumor stage and histopathological features. Seven Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, three of which were evaluated as possibily or probably deleterious variant. Interestingly, almost all the 22 mammary tumors (except one) which presented a clinical staging equal to or greater than III carried at least one mutant allele of these three variants. Besides that, no statistically significant correlation was observed between any of the reported SNPs in heterozygosis or homozygosis and either dogs data (such as breed, age or disease stage) or mammary tumors histopathological characteristics. A total of 97.9% of bitches had one to three polymorphisms of the seven identified in this study, which suggests a possibly correlation between the canine BRCA2 exon 11 polymorphisms and mammary carcinogenesis.",

With relatively little is known about the genetic abnormalities present in these secondary tumors, we examined genomic variation in biospecimens from radiation-associated breast angiosarcomas.                 Patients were identified that had a previous breast cancer diagnosis, received radiation therapy, and developed angiosarcoma in the ipsilateral breast as the earlier cancer. Tumor regions were isolated from archival blocks using subsequent laser capture microdissection. Next generation sequencing was performed using a targeted panel of 160 cancer-related genes. Genomic variants were identified for mutation and trinucleotide-based mutational signature analysis.                 44 variants in 34 genes were found in more than two thirds of the cases; this included 12 variants identified as potentially deleterious. Of particular note, the BRCA1 DNA damage response pathway was highly enriched with genetic variation. In a comparison to local recurrences, 14 variants in 11 genes were present in both the primary and recurrent lesions including variants in genes associated with the DNA damage response machinery. Furthermore, the mutational signature analysis shows that a previously defined IR signature is present in almost all of the current samples characterized by predominantly C→T substitutions.                 While radiation-associated breast angiosarcomas are relatively uncommon, their prognosis is very poor. These data demonstrate a mutational pattern associated with genes involved in DNA repair. While important in revealing the biology behind these tumors, it may also suggest new treatment strategies that will prove successful.",

To comprehensively characterize the mutational landscape of this tumor type, and to identify possible targets of treatment, we conducted the first large exome sequencing study on a population-based set of SBA samples from all three small bowel segments. Archival tissue from 106 primary tumors with appropriate clinical information were available for exome sequencing from a patient series consisting of a majority of confirmed SBA cases diagnosed in Finland between the years 2003-2011. Paired-end exome sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 4000, and OncodriveFML was used to identify driver genes from the exome data. We also defined frequently affected cancer signalling pathways and performed the first extensive allelic imbalance (AI) analysis in SBA. Exome data analysis revealed significantly mutated genes previously linked to SBA (TP53, KRAS, APC, SMAD4, and BRAF), recently reported potential driver genes (SOX9, ATM, and ARID2), as well as novel candidate driver genes, such as ACVR2A, ACVR1B, BRCA2, and SMARCA4. We also identified clear mutation hotspot patterns in ERBB2 and BRAF. No BRAF V600E mutations were observed. Additionally, we present a comprehensive mutation signature analysis of SBA, highlighting established signatures 1A, 6, and 17, as well as U2 which is a previously unvalidated signature. Finally, comparison of the three small bowel segments revealed differences in tumor characteristics. This comprehensive work unveils the mutational landscape and most frequently affected genes and pathways in SBA, providing potential therapeutic targets, and novel and more thorough insights into the genetic background of this tumor type.",

We wanted to evaluate mutation patterns in 20 breast cancer susceptibility genes and correlate the mutations with clinical characteristics to determine the effects of these germline mutations on breast cancer prognosis.                 The study cohort included 480 ethnic Chinese individuals in Taiwan with at least one of the six clinical risk factors for hereditary breast cancer: family history of breast or ovarian cancer, young age of onset for breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, both breast and ovarian cancer, and male breast cancer. PCR-enriched amplicon-sequencing on a next generation sequencing platform was used to determine the germline DNA sequences of all exons and exon-flanking regions of the 20 genes. Protein-truncating variants were identified as pathogenic.                 We detected a 13.5% carrier rate of pathogenic germline mutations, with BRCA2 being the most prevalent and the non-BRCA genes accounting for 38.5% of the mutation carriers. BRCA mutation carriers were more likely to be diagnosed of breast cancer with lymph node involvement (66.7% vs 42.6%; P = 0.011), and had significantly worse breast cancer specific outcomes. The 5-year disease-free survival was 73.3% for BRCA mutation carriers and 91.1% for non-carriers (hazard ratio for recurrence or death 2.42, 95% CI 1.29-4.53; P = 0.013). After adjusting for clinical prognostic factors, BRCA mutation remained an independent poor prognostic factor for cancer recurrence or death (adjusted hazard ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.40-6.58; P = 0.005). Non-BRCA gene mutation carriers did not exhibit any significant difference in cancer characteristics or outcomes compared to those without detected mutations. Among the risk factors for hereditary breast cancer, the odds of detecting a germline mutation increased significantly with having bilateral breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio 3.27, 95% CI 1.64-6.51; P = 0.0008) or having more than one risk factor (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.22-3.51; P = 0.007).

Due to the lack of validated target molecules, no targeted therapy for TNBC is approved. Tissue factor (TF) is a common yet specific surface target receptor for cancer cells, tumor vascular endothelial cells, and cancer stem cells in several types of solid cancers, including breast cancer. Here, we report evidence supporting the idea that TF is a surface target in TNBC. We usedin vitro cancer lines andin vivo tumor xenografts in mice, all withBRCA1 orBRCA2 mutations, derived from patients' tumors. We showed that TF is overexpressed on TNBC cells and tumor neovasculature in 50% to 85% of TNBC patients (n = 161) and in TNBC cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from mice, but was not detected in adjacent normal breast tissue. We then describe the development of a second-generation TF-targeting immunoconjugate (called L-ICON1, for lighter or light chain ICON) with improved efficacy and safety profiles compared with the original ICON. We showed that L-ICON1 kills TNBC cellsin vitro via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and can be used to treat human and murine TNBC CDX as well as PDXin vivo in orthotopic mouse models. Thus, TF could be a useful target for the development of immunotherapeutics for TNBC patients, with or withoutBRCA1 andBRCA2 mutations.Cancer Immunol Res; 6(6); 671-84. ©2018 AACR.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) is most frequently caused by mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (in short, BRCA) genes. The incidence of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in relatives of BRCA mutation carriers who test negative for the familial mutation (non-carriers) may be increased. However, the data is controversial, and at this time, these individuals are recommended the same cancer surveillance as general population. One possible explanation for BRCA phenocopies (close relatives of BRCA carriers who have developed cancer consistent with HBOC but tested negative for a familial mutation) is natural chimerism where lack of detectable mutation in blood may not rule out the presence of the mutation in the other tissues. To test this hypothesis, archival tumor tissue from eleven BRCA phenocopies was investigated. DNA from the tumor tissue was analyzed using sequence-specific PCR, capillary electrophoresis, and pyrosequencing. The familial mutations were originally detected in the patients' first-degree relatives by commercial testing. The same testing detected no mutations in the blood of the patients under study. The test methods targeted only the known familial mutation in the tumor tissue. Tumor diagnoses included breast, ovarian, endometrial and primary peritoneal carcinoma. None of the familial mutations were found in the tumor samples tested. These results do not support, but do not completely exclude, the possibility of chimerism in these patients. Further studies with comprehensive sequence analysis in a larger patient group are warranted as a chimeric state would further refine the predictive value of genetic testing to include BRCA phenocopies.",

    "abstract": "The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene is a moderate-risk breast cancer susceptibility gene; germline loss-of-function variants are found in up to 3% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families who undergo genetic testing. So far, no clear histopathological and molecular features of breast tumours occurring in ATM deleterious variant carriers have been described, but identification of an ATM-associated tumour signature may help in patient management.                 To characterise hallmarks of ATM-associated tumours, we performed systematic pathology review of tumours from 21 participants from ataxia-telangiectasia families and 18 participants from HBOC families, as well as copy number profiling on a subset of 23 tumours. Morphology of ATM-associated tumours was compared with that of 599 patients with no BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations from a hospital-based series, as well as with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Absolute copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) profiles were obtained from the OncoScan SNP array. In addition, we performed whole-genome sequencing on four tumours from ATM loss-of-function variant carriers with available frozen material.                 We found that ATM-associated tumours belong mostly to the luminal B subtype, are tetraploid and show LOH at the ATM locus at 11q22-23. Unlike tumours in which BRCA1 or BRCA2 is inactivated, tumours arising in ATM deleterious variant carriers are not associated with increased large-scale genomic instability as measured by the large-scale state transitions signature. Losses at 13q14.11-q14.3, 17p13.2-p12, 21p11.2-p11.1 and 22q11.23 were observed. Somatic alterations at these loci may therefore represent biomarkers for ATM testing and harbour driver mutations in potentially 'druggable' genes that would allow patients to be directed towards tailored therapeutic strategies.                 Although ATM is involved in the DNA damage response, ATM-associated tumours are distinct from BRCA1-associated tumours in terms of morphological characteristics and genomic alterations, and they are also distinguishable from sporadic breast tumours, thus opening up the possibility to identify ATM variant carriers outside the ataxia-telangiectasia disorder and direct them towards effective cancer risk management and therapeutic strategies.",

We analyzed the clinical characteristics, cancer history, and mutations according to the putative functional domain of BRCA proteins among 229 women with BRCA1/2 mutations who were treated at Yonsei Cancer Center, Severance Hospital between January 2009 and March 2017.                 Twenty-two carriers (18.8% of 117 BRCA1 mutation carriers) with mutations located in the BRCT domain region had a higher risk of breast cancers (hazard ratio [HR], 2.851; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.614-5.039; P < .001) than those with mutations outside of the putative functional domains of BRCA1. The risk of ovarian cancer was increased in 13 (11.6%) of 112 BRCA2 mutation carriers, with mutations located on BRC repeat regions (HR, 3.129; 95% CI, 1.123-8.720; P = .029). The term-pregnancies number was a significant risk-reducing factor for breast cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR per pregnancy, 0.640; 95% CI, 0.508-0.806; P < .001), for breast cancers in BRCA2 mutation carriers (HR per pregnancy, 0.534; 95% CI, 0.419-0.681; P < .001), and for ovarian cancers for BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR per pregnancy, 0.625; 95% CI, 0.474-0.824; P = .001).

    "abstract": "Approximately 5-10% of breast cancers are attributable to genetic susceptibility. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the best known genetic factors to date. The goal of this study was to determine the structure and distribution of haplotypes of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in early-onset breast cancer patients. We enrolled 70 patients diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer. A total of 21 SNPs (11 on BRCA1 and 10 on BRCA2) and 1 dinucleotide deletion on BRCA1 were genotyped using nested allele-specific PCR methods. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was conducted, and haplotypes were deduced from the genotype data. Two tightly linked LD blocks were observed on each of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Variant-free haplotypes (TAT-AG for BRCA1 and ATA-AAT for BRCA2) were observed at a frequency of more than 50% on each gene along with variable frequencies of derived haplotypes. The variant 3'-subhaplotype CGC displayed strong LD with 5'-subhaplotypes GA, AA, and GG on BRCA1 gene. Haplotypes ATA-AGT, ATC-AAT, and ATA-AAC were the variant haplotypes frequent on BRCA2 gene. Although the clinical significance of these derived haplotypes has not yet been established, it is expected that some of these haplotypes, especially the less frequent subhaplotypes, eventually will be shown to be indicative of a predisposition to early-onset breast cancer.",

Our aim was to understand the involvement of the inherited mutations in these genes in a breast cancer cohort. Two hundred ninety-six female breast cancer patients including 4.5% of familial breast cancer cases were included in the study. 200 ng of genomic DNA was used to evaluate the pathogenic mutations, detected using Global Screening Array (GSA) microchip (Illumina Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pathogenic frameshift and nonsense mutations were observed in BRCA2 (10.9%), MLH1 (58.6%), MTHFR (50%), MSH2 (14.2%), and CYTB (52%) genes. Familial breast cancer patients (4.5%) had variations in BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, and CYTB genes. 28% of patients with metastasis, recurrence, and death harbored mono/biallelic alterations in MSH2, MLH1, and BRCA2 genes. The results of this study can guide to develop a panel to test the breast cancer patients for pathogenic mutations, from Malwa region of Punjab. The screening of MSH2, MLH1, and BRCA2 should be carried in individuals with or without family history of breast cancer as these genes have been reported to increase the cancer risk by tenfold.",

    "abstract": "Germline pathogenic variants in the BRCA2 gene are associated with a cumulative high risk of breast/ovarian cancer. SeveralBRCA2 variants result in complete loss of the exon-3 at the transcript level. The pathogenicity of these variants and the functional impact of loss of exon 3 have yet to be established. As a collaboration of the COVAR clinical trial group (France), and the ENIGMA consortium for investigating breast cancer gene variants, this study evaluated 8BRCA2 variants resulting in complete deletion of exon 3. Clinical information for 39 families was gathered from Portugal, France, Denmark and Sweden. Multifactorial likelihood analyses were conducted using information from 293 patients, for 7 out of the 8 variants (including 6 intronic). For all variants combined the likelihood ratio in favor of causality was 4.39*1025. These results provide convincing evidence for the pathogenicity of all examined variants that lead to a total exon 3 skipping, and suggest that other variants that result in complete loss of exon 3 at the molecular level could be associated with a high risk of cancer comparable to that associated with classical pathogenic variants inBRCA1 orBRCA2 gene. In addition, our functional study shows, for the first time, that deletion of exon 3 impairs the ability of cells to survive upon Mitomycin-C treatment, supporting lack of function for the altered BRCA2 protein in these cells. Finally, this study demonstrates that any variant leading to expression of onlyBRCA2 delta-exon 3 will be associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent malignancy in both pre- and postmenopausal women. However, it is exceedingly rare in very young patients, and especially in adolescents. Herein, we report a case of an 18-year-old female diagnosed with invasive BC. The proband had been found to be negative for BC in close family members. A common BC genetic screening test for the Polish population did not detect any known founder mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Further evaluation identified a p.Ile157Thr (I157T) mutation in the CHEK2 gene, a p.Ala1991Val (A1991V) variant of unknown significance in the BRCA2 gene, p.Lys751Gln (K751Q) variant in the XPD (ERCC2) gene, and a homozygous p.Glu1008Ter (E1008*) mutation in the NOD2 gene. No other mutation had been found by next generation sequencing in major BC high-risk susceptibility genes BRCA1, BRCA2, as well as 92 other genes. To date, all these found alterations have been considered as low to moderate risk factors in the general population and moderate risk factors in younger women (<35 years of age). There are no previous articles relating low and moderate risk gene mutations to very young onset (below 20 years) BC with a fatal outcome. In our patient, a possible cumulative or synergistic risk effect for these 4 alterations, and a mutation in the NOD2 gene in particular, of which both presumably healthy parents were found to be carriers, is suggested.",

Along with germline testing within the context of familial or sporadic ovarian cancer, patients are now being referred forBRCA1/2 genetic assay above all for treatment decisions: in this setting tumour BRCA assay can allow to identify an estimated 3-9% of patients with peculiar somaticBRCA1/2 mutations. These women could also benefit from PARPi therapy. This new type of approach is really challenging, in particular due to the technical and analytical difficulties regarding low quality DNA deriving from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens.                 in this manuscript, we try to a) underline many issues related to BRCA1/2 analysis by next generation sequencing technologies (NGS), b) provide some responses to many questions regarding this new paradigm related to OvCa patients' management.

How cells with defects in this pathway respond to DNA damage in vivo and how tumors develop from these cells remain poorly defined. Here, we analyzed several aspects of the DNA damage response in multiple tissues ofPalb2-mutant mice in which the interaction between PALB2 and BRCA1 is disengaged. Without any challenge, the mutant mice showed increased endogenous DNA damage. Following ionizing radiation, the mutant mice displayed higher levels of DNA breaks and stronger induction of p53 and p21, but continued DNA synthesis, reduced apoptosis, and accelerated tumor development. The differences in p21 induction, DNA synthesis, and apoptosis between wild-type and mutant mice were substantially more pronounced in the mammary gland than in the intestine, suggesting a potential contributing factor to the increased risk and the tissue specificity ofBRCA/PALB2-associated tumor development. Moreover, the mutant mice showed higher levels of reactive oxygen species and constitutive activation of NF-κB, an antiapoptotic transcription factor inducible by both DNA damage and oxidative stress. Treatment of the mutant mice with an inhibitor of NF-κB reactivated apoptosis and delayed tumor development following radiation. Thus, our results also suggest a prosurvival and pro-oncogenic role of NF-κB inPALB2-mutant cells.Significance: This study explores novel tumor suppression mechanisms of the BRCA1-PALB2 DNA damage response pathway and implicates NF-κB activation as a protumorogenic event and possible therapeutic target.Cancer Res; 78(14); 3969-81. ©2018 AACR.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck cancer (HNC), the sixth most common cancer globally, stands second in India. In Northeast (NE) India, it is the sixth most common cause of death in males and seventh in females. Prolonged tobacco and alcohol consumption constitute the major etiological factors for HNC development, which induce DNA damage. Therefore, DNA repair pathway is a crucial system in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing carcinogenesis. The present work was aimed to predict the consequence of significant germline variants of the DNA repair genes in disease predisposition. Whole exome sequencing was performed in Ion Proton™ platform on 15 case-control samples from the HNC-prevalent states of Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Variant annotation was done in Ion Reporter™ as well as wANNOVAR. Subsequent statistical and bioinformatics analysis identified significant exonic and intronic variants associated with HNC. Amongst our observed variants, 78.6% occurred in ExAC, 94% reported in dbSNP and 5.8% & 9.3% variants were present in ClinVar and HGMD, respectively. The total variants were dispersed among 199 genes with DSBR and FA pathway being the most mutated pathways. The allelic association test suggested that the intronic variants in HLTF and RAD52 gene significantly associated (P < 0.05) with the risk (OR > 5), while intronic variants in PARP4, RECQL5, EXO1 and PER1 genes and exonic variant in TDP2 gene showed protection (OR < 1) for HNC. MDR analysis proposed the exonic variants in MSH6, BRCA2, PALB2 and TP53 genes and intronic variant in RECQL5 genetic region working together during certain phase of DNA repair mechanism for HNC causation. In addition, other intronic and 3'UTR variations caused modifications in the transcription factor binding sites and miRNA target sites associated with HNC. Large-scale validation in NE Indian population, in-depth structure prediction and subsequent simulation of our recognized polymorphisms is necessary to identify true causal variants related to HNC.",

Spliceogenic variants exemplify this issue as each nucleotide variant can be deleterious via disruption or creation of splice site consensus sequences. Consequently, reliable in silico prediction of variant spliceogenicity would be a major improvement. Thanks to an international effort, a set of 395 variants studied at the mRNA level and occurring in 5' and 3' consensus regions (defined as the 11 and 14 bases surrounding the exon/intron junction, respectively) was collected for 11 different genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, CFTR and RHD, and used to train and validate a new prediction protocol named Splicing Prediction in Consensus Elements (SPiCE). SPiCE combines in silico predictions from SpliceSiteFinder-like and MaxEntScan and uses logistic regression to define optimal decision thresholds. It revealed an unprecedented sensitivity and specificity of 99.5 and 95.2%, respectively, and the impact on splicing was correctly predicted for 98.8% of variants. We therefore propose SPiCE as the new tool for predicting variant spliceogenicity. It could be easily implemented in any diagnostic laboratory as a routine decision making tool to help geneticists to face the deluge of variants in the next-generation sequencing era.

The combination of a dysfunctional homologous recombination repair system and a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor results in a synthetic lethal phenotype. The PARP inhibitor olaparib, approved as a monotherapy for patients with a germline BRCA mutation, has shown promising results in preclinical studies when combined with DNA damaging agents, such as carboplatin. However, dose-limiting toxicities have hindered the use of a combination therapy with olaparib in the clinical setting. By concurrent administration of carboplatin and olaparib at various molar ratios of drugs, the aim of this study was to explore the optimal dosing ratio of carboplatin-olaparib combinations in a comprehensive panel of eight BRCA-proficient and -deficient high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cell lines. Overall, synergy was observed in the BRCA1/2-mutated or defective cell lines when olaparib was combined at lower molar ratios of olaparib to carboplatin. Immunostaining of γH2AX foci revealed increased DNA damage as a result of this synergistic drug combination in the UWB1.289 paired cell lines. In vitro activity of the individual agents, carboplatin and olaparib, did not correlate with PARP1 expression in each cell line. Importantly, synergism was also observed in a subset of BRCA wild-type cell lines (OV90 and PEO4) suggesting therapeutic benefits of this combination beyond BRCA-dependent synthetic lethality. The administration of drugs at synergistic ratios has the potential to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Most pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 gene carry a high risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). However, a stop-gain mutation, K3326* (rs11571833), confers risk of lung cancer and cancers of the upper-aero-digestive tract but only a modest risk of breast or ovarian cancer. The Icelandic population provides an opportunity for comprehensive characterization of the cancer risk profiles of K3326* and HBOC mutations because a single mutation, BRCA2 999del5, is responsible for almost all BRCA2-related HBOC in the population.                 Genotype information on 43 641 cancer patients and 370 971 control subjects from Iceland, the Netherlands, and the United States was used to assess the cancer risk profiles of K3326* and BRCA2 999del5. BRCA2 expression was assessed using RNAseq data from blood (n = 2233), as well as 52 tissues reported in the GTEx database.                 The cancer risks associated with K3326* are fundamentally different from those associated with 999del5. We report for the first time an association between K3326* and small cell lung cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.35 to 3.16) and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.26 to 2.26). Individuals homozygous for K3326* reach old age and have children. Unlike BRCA2 999del5, the K3326* allele does not affect the level of BRCA2 transcripts, and the allele is expressed to the same extent as the wild-type allele.                 K3326* associates primarily with cancers that have strong environmental genotoxic risk factors. Expression of the K3326* allele suggests that a variant protein may be made that retains the DNA repair capabilities important to hormone-responsive tissues but may be less efficient in responding to genotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "PCR-based RNA splicing assays are commonly used in diagnostic and research settings to assess the potential effects of variants of uncertain clinical significance in BRCA1 andBRCA2. The Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium completed a multicentre investigation to evaluate differences in assay design and the integrity of published data, raising a number of methodological questions associated with cell culture conditions and PCR-based protocols. We utilized targeted RNA-seq to re-assessBRCA1 andBRCA2 mRNA isoform expression patterns in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) previously used in the multicentre ENIGMA study. Capture of the targeted cDNA sequences was carried out using 34BRCA1 and 28BRCA2 oligonucleotides from the Illumina Truseq Targeted RNA Expression platform. Our results show that targeted RNA-seq analysis of LCLs overcomes many of the methodology limitations associated with PCR-based assays leading us to make the following observations and recommendations: (1) technical replicates (n > 2) of variant carriers to capture methodology induced variability associated with RNA-seq assays, (2) LCLs can undergo multiple freeze/thaw cycles and can be cultured up to 2 weeks without noticeably influencing isoform expression levels, (3) nonsense-mediated decay inhibitors are essential prior to splicing assays for comprehensive mRNA isoform detection, (4) quantitative assessment of exon:exon junction levels acrossBRCA1 andBRCA2 can help distinguish between normal and aberrant isoform expression patterns. Experimentally derived recommendations from this study will facilitate the application of targeted RNA-seq platforms for the quantitation ofBRCA1 andBRCA2 mRNA aberrations associated with sequence variants of uncertain clinical significance.",

    "abstract": "Germline mutations BRCA1 and BRCA2 contribute almost equally in the causation of breast cancer (BC). The type of mutations in the Indian population that cause this condition is largely unknown.                 In this cohort, 79 randomized BC patients were screened for various types of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations including frameshift, nonsense, missense, in-frame and splice site types.                 The purified extracted DNA of each referral patient was subjected to Sanger gene sequencing using Codon Code Analyzer and Mutation Surveyor and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods with Ion torrent software, after appropriate care.                 The data revealed that 35 cases were positive for BRCA1 or BRCA2 (35/79: 44.3%). BRCA2 mutations were higher (52.4%) than BRCA1 mutations (47.6%). Five novel mutations detected in this study were p.pro163 frameshift, p.asn997 frameshift, p.ser148 frameshift and two splice site single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Additionally, four nonsense and one in-frame deletion were identified, which all seemed to be pathogenic. Polymorphic SNPs contributed the highest percentage of mutations (72/82: 87.8%) and contributed to pathogenic, likely pathogenic, likely benign, benign and variant of unknown significance (VUS). Young age groups (20-60 years) had a high frequency of germline mutations (62/82;75.6%) in the Indian population.                 This study suggested that polymorphic SNPs contributed a high percentage of mutations along with five novel types. Younger age groups are prone to having BC with a higher mutational rate. Furthermore, the SNPs detected in exons 10, 11 and 16 of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were higher than those in other exons 2, 3 and 9 polymorphic sites in two germline genes. These may be contributory for BC although missense types are known to be susceptible for cancer depending on the type of amino acid replaced in the protein and associated with pathologic events. Accordingly, appropriate counseling and treatment may be suggested.",

    "abstract": "Changes (or variants) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene sequences can have different lengths and clinical significance: from single nucleotide variants (SNV) and short insertions/deletions (<50 bp) to extended deletions and duplications (so-called copy number variations, or CNV). According to their clinical significance, all variants can be divided into pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. Moreover, variants can be germinal (i.e. inherited from parents) and somatic (arising in the process of development of the organism). A specific somatic event is loss of heterozygosity (LOH), i.e. transition of one or many point and short variants from heterozygous to homozygous state. Such an event can be the key to the development of carcinogenesis for cells carrying a pathogenic variant, if we consider it within the framework of the Knudson's two-hit carcinogenesis theory. We studied the prevalence and nature of LOH in of ovarian cancer samples carrying or not carrying a pathogenic variant. To this end, a full coding sequence of BRCA1/2 genes was determined in 30 pairs of DNA samples isolated from blood cells and paraffinized histological blocks of patients on a MiSeq Illumina instrument. Analyss of the obtained reads revealed 9 pathogenic point and short variants (30% patients): 6 germinal (20%) and 3 somatic (10%), and 8 somatic CNV (3 deletions and 5 duplications of several or all exons of the BRCA1 gene). LOH was detected in 70% patients; among the carriers of pathogenic variants - in 83%. For pathogenic variants, the percentage of reads with the alternative allele increased more often than for benign variants located in another gene, or detected in other patients (67% vs. 44%). However, the difference was statistically insignificant, which can be due to insufficient number of patients. Only in 3 of 21 cases of LOH (14%), it can be attributed to CNV. In other cases, LOH is most likely determined by gene conversion, but further research is needed.",

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an important target for such precision chemotherapies because of its dismal prognosis. We analyzed mutations in the entire coding regions of the BRCA pathway genes, expression of breast cancer 2 (BRCA2), and mutations in hotspots of 50 cancer-associated genes in 42 surgically resected PDACs, and evaluated their associations with clinicopathological features. We identified 13 rare germline mutations in the BRCA pathway genes; 68 somatic mutations in KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, GNAS, SMARCB1, and RB1; and 2 germline variations in MLH1. Among them, BRCA2S2148fs was known to be pathogenic. BRCA2R18H and BRCA2G2044V were enriched in tumor tissues. BRCA2K799R and BRCA2R2964T were novel germline variations. Patients harboring potentially deleterious mutations in the BRCA pathway genes showed significantly better prognosis than those with benign mutations or no mutation. These results indicate that rare germline variations in BRCA pathway genes could be found more frequently than previously anticipated and, more importantly, potentially deleterious mutations of them could be a favorable prognostic factor in patients with resectable PDACs.",

First, we searched for rare variants in 27 known HBC genes and identified two patients harboring truncating pathogenic variants inATM andBARD1. For the remaining 15 negative patients, we found a substantial vast number of rare genetic variants. Thus, for selecting the most promising variants we used functional-based variant prioritization, followed by NGS validation, analysis in a control group, cosegregation analysis in one family and comparison with previous WES studies, shrinking our list to 23 novel BC candidate genes, which were evaluated in an independent cohort of 42 high-risk BC patients. Rare and possibly damaging variants were identified in 12 candidate genes in this cohort, including variants in DNA repair genes (ERCC1 andSXL4) and other cancer-related genes (NOTCH2, ERBB2, MST1R, andRAF1). Overall, this is the first WES study applied for identifying novel genes associated to HBC in Brazilian patients, in which we provide a set of putative BC predisposing genes.

    "abstract": "A family history of breast cancer has long been thought to indicate the presence of inherited genetic events that predispose to this disease. In North Africa, many specific epidemio-genetic characteristics have been observed in breast cancer families when compared to Western populations. Despite these specificities, the majority of breast cancer genetics studies performed in North Africa remain restricted to the investigation of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Thus, comprehensive data at a whole exome or whole genome level from local patients are lacking.                 A whole exome sequencing (WES) of seven breast cancer Tunisian families have been performed using a family-based approach. We focused our analysis on BC-TN-F001 family that included two affected members that have been sequenced using WES. Relevant variants identified in BC-TN-F001 have been confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Then, we conducted an integrative analysis by combining our results with those from other WES studies in order to figure out the genetic transmission model of the newly identified genes. Biological network construction and protein-protein interactions analyses have been performed to decipher the molecular mechanisms likely accounting for the role of these genes in breast cancer risk.                 Sequencing, filtering strategies, and validation analysis have been achieved. For BC-TN-F001, no deleterious mutations have been identified on known breast cancer genes. However, 373 heterozygous, exonic and rare variants have been identified on other candidate genes. After applying several filters, 12 relevant high-risk variants have been selected. Our results showed that these variants seem to be inherited in a family specific model. This hypothesis has been confirmed following a thorough analysis of the reported WES studies. Enriched biological process and protein-protein interaction networks resulted in the identification of four novel breast cancer candidate genes namely MMS19, DNAH3, POLK and KATB6.                 In this first WES application on Tunisian breast cancer patients, we highlighted the impact of next generation sequencing technologies in the identification of novel breast cancer candidate genes which may bring new insights into the biological mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis. Our findings showed that the breast cancer predisposition in non-BRCA families may be ethnic and/or family specific.",

    "abstract": "Genetic testing of BRCA1 andBRCA2 identifies a large number of variants of uncertain clinical significance whose functional and clinical interpretations pose a challenge for genetic counseling. Interestingly, a relevant fraction of DNA variants can disrupt the splicing process in cancer susceptibility genes. We have tested more than 200 variants throughout 19 BRCA2 exons mostly by minigene assays, 54% of which displayed aberrant splicing, thus confirming the utility of this assay to check genetic variants in the absence of patient RNA. Our goal was to investigateBRCA2 exon 16 with a view to characterizing spliceogenic variants recorded at the mutational databases. Seventy-two different BIC and UMD variants were analyzed with NNSplice and Human Splicing Finder, 12 of which were selected because they were predicted to disrupt essential splice motifs: canonical splice sites (ss; eight variants) and exonic/intronic splicing enhancers (four variants). These 12 candidate variants were introduced into the BRCA2 minigene with seven exons (14-20) by site-directed mutagenesis and then transfected into MCF-7 cells. Seven variants (six intronic and one missense) induced complete abnormal splicing patterns: c.7618-2A>T, c.7618-2A>G, c.7618-1G>C, c.7618-1G>A, c.7805G>C, c.7805+1G>A, and c.7805+3A>C, as well as a partial anomalous outcome by c.7802A>G. They generated at least 10 different transcripts: Δ16p44 (alternative 3'ss 44-nt downstream; acceptor variants), Δ16 (exon 16-skipping; donor variants), Δ16p55 (alternative 3'ss 55-nt downstream), Δ16q4 (alternative 5'ss 4-nt upstream), Δ16q100 (alternative 5'ss 4-nt upstream), ▾16q20 (alternative 5'ss 20-nt downstream), as well as minor (Δ16p93 and Δ16,17p69) and uncharacterized transcripts of 893 and 954 nucleotides. Isoforms Δ16p44, Δ16, Δ16p55, Δ16q4, Δ16q100, and ▾16q20 introduced premature termination codons which presumably inactivate BRCA2. According to the guidelines the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics these eight variants could be classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic whereas the Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles rules suggested seven class 4 and one class 3 variants. In conclusion, our study highlights the relevance of splicing functional assays by hybrid minigenes for the clinical classification of genetic variations. Hence, we provide new data about spliceogenic variants of BRCA2 exon 16 that are directly correlated with breast cancer susceptibility.",

The mutational profile of BRCA1/2 in families at risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer has not so far been reported in Andalusia (southern Spain).                 We analysed BRCA1/2 germline mutations in 562 high-risk cases with breast and/or ovarian cancer from Andalusian families from 2010 to 2015.                 Among the 562 cases, 120 (21.4%) carried a germline pathogenic mutation in BRCA1/2; 50 in BRCA1 (41.7%) and 70 in BRCA2 (58.3%). We detected 67 distinct mutations (29 in BRCA1 and 38 in BRCA2), of which 3 in BRCA1 (c.845C > A, c.1222_1223delAC, c.2527delA) and 5 in BRCA2 (c.293 T > G, c.5558_5559delGT, c.6034delT, c.6650_6654delAAGAT, c.6652delG) had not been previously described.

A total of 5‑10% of breast cancer and 10‑15% of ovarian cancer cases are caused by a hereditary breast‑ovarian cancer syndrome, with mutations predominantly identified in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Recently, the Mexican founder mutation BRCA1 ex9‑12del was identified (deletion of exons 9‑12 with recombination between introns 8‑12). This is the most frequently reported mutation in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in Mexico. Current detection methods include end‑point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Multiplex Ligation‑dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). In the present study a cheap, sensitive and fast detection method was developed based on quantitative PCR and two TaqMan® probes, one to detect the deletion (recombination region between introns 8 and 12), and the other one a region from exon 11. With this assay, 90 samples were able to be analyzed in 2 h using 2.5 ng of DNA/reaction at a cost of ~2‑3 USD. This method is capable of detecting positive samples for DNA deletion and excluding negative ones. Therefore, the method proposed may be a useful high‑throughput diagnostic option that could be useful in future association or prevalence studies that use large populations.",

We sequenced germline whole exomes from 139 aggressive (metastatic, age of diagnosis < 60) and 141 non-aggressive (low clinical grade, age of diagnosis ≥60) PrCa cases. We conducted rare variant association analyses at gene and gene set levels using SKAT and Bayesian risk index techniques. GO term enrichment analysis was performed for genes with the highest differential burden of rare disruptive variants.                 Protein truncating variants (PTVs) in specific DNA repair genes were significantly overrepresented among patients with the aggressive phenotype, with BRCA2, ATM and NBN the most frequently mutated genes. Differential burden of rare variants was identified between metastatic and non-aggressive cases for several genes implicated in angiogenesis, conferring both deleterious and protective effects.                 Inherited PTVs in several DNA repair genes distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive PrCa cases. Furthermore, inherited variants in genes with roles in angiogenesis may be potential predictors for risk of metastases. If validated in a larger dataset, these findings have potential for future clinical application.",

Individuals were classified based on carrying a deleterious mutation in cancer predisposition genes and having a personal or family history of cancer.                 Germline mutations in coding regions of 21 cancer predisposition genes were identified by sequencing of products from a custom multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based panel; associations of genes with pancreatic cancer were assessed by comparing frequency of mutations in genes of pancreatic cancer patients with those of reference controls.

    "abstract": "BRCA1/2 variant analysis in tumor tissue could streamline the referral of patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer to genetic counselors and select patients who benefit most from targeted treatment. We investigated the sensitivity of BRCA1/2 variant analysis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue using a combination of next-generation sequencing and copy number variant multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. After optimization using a training cohort of known BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, validation was performed in a prospective cohort (clinical implementation of BRCA1/2 screening in ovarian tumor tissue cohort) in which screening of BRCA1/2 tumor DNA and leukocyte germline DNA was performed in parallel. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation and pedigree analysis were also performed. In the training cohort, 45 of 46 germline BRCA1/2 variants were detected (sensitivity, 98%). In the clinical implementation of BRCA1/2 screening on ovarian tumor tissue cohort (n = 62), all six germline variants were identified (sensitivity, 100%), together with five somatic BRCA1/2 variants and eight cases with BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation. In four BRCA1/2 variant-negative patients, surveillance or prophylactic management options were offered on the basis of positive family histories. We conclude that BRCA1/2 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue analysis reliably detects BRCA1/2 variants. When taking family history of BRCA1/2 variant-negative patients into account, tumor BRCA1/2 variant screening allows more efficient selection of epithelial ovarian cancer patients for genetic counseling and simultaneously selects patients who benefit most from targeted treatment.",

A minority of mutations were identified in non-BRCA1/2 genes and consisted mainly of AJ founder mutations in CHEK2, APC, and the mismatch repair genes.

    "abstract": "Germline pathogenic variants in the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene BRCA1 are associated with a 60% lifetime risk for breast and ovarian cancer. This overall risk estimate is for all BRCA1 variants; obviously, not all variants confer the same risk of developing a disease. In cancer patients, loss of BRCA1 function in tumor tissue has been associated with an increased sensitivity to platinum agents and to poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. For clinical management of both at-risk individuals and cancer patients, it would be important that each identified genetic variant be associated with clinical significance. Unfortunately for the vast majority of variants, the clinical impact is unknown. The availability of results from studies assessing the impact of variants on protein function may provide insight of crucial importance.                 We have collected, curated, and structured the molecular and cellular phenotypic impact of 3654 distinct BRCA1 variants. The data was modeled in triple format, using the variant as a subject, the studied function as the object, and a predicate describing the relation between the two. Each annotation is supported by a fully traceable evidence. The data was captured using standard ontologies to ensure consistency, and enhance searchability and interoperability. We have assessed the extent to which functional defects at the molecular and cellular levels correlate with the clinical interpretation of variants by ClinVar submitters. Approximately 30% of the ClinVar BRCA1 missense variants have some molecular or cellular assay available in the literature. Pathogenic variants (as assigned by ClinVar) have at least some significant functional defect in 94% of testable cases. For benign variants, 77% of ClinVar benign variants, for which neXtProt Cancer variant portal has data, shows either no or mild experimental functional defects. While this does not provide evidence for clinical interpretation of variants, it may provide some guidance for variants of unknown significance, in the absence of more reliable data. The neXtProt Cancer variant portal ( https://www.nextprot.org/portals/breast-cancer ) contains over 6300 observations at the molecular and/or cellular level for BRCA1 variants.",

This suggests that deficiency in the BRCA-related DNA repair mechanism may also be a surrogate marker for immunotherapy response. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, in women withBRCA gene mutations and recurrent müllerian cancer. This retrospective case series followed sixBRCA carriers who received nivolumab monotherapy (3.0 mg/kg, intravenous, day 1 and 15, every 4 weeks) as salvage therapy for recurrent epithelial ovarian (n = 5) and fallopian tubal (n = 1) cancers. Toxicity, treatment response, and survival were examined. Median age was 57 (range 51-64).BRCA1 and 2 mutations were equally distributed. All had high-grade serous histology, and all but one had advanced-stage disease at initial diagnosis. The majority had platinum-resistant disease (n = 4). All received salvage therapy prior to nivolumab therapy (median 3 lines), including PARP inhibitors (n = 3). The median number of nivolumab treatment cycles was 9, including 2 women receiving 18 cycles. Three women developed nivolumab-related toxicities, most commonly grade 2 hypothyroidism (n = 2). Median follow-up time was 13.4 months, and there were 3 complete responses, 1 partial response, and 2 patients with progressive disease. Objective response rate was 67% (4 out of 6). In conclusion, our study suggests that nivolumab monotherapy is well-tolerated and may be an effective salvage therapy forBRCA mutation carriers with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, and primary peritoneal cancers.",

However, for other predisposition genes, studies concerning the risk and penetrance to TNBC are relatively scarce. Very few recurrent mutations, including TP53 and PI3KCA mutations, together with a long tail of individually rare mutations occur in TNBC.

    "abstract": "In this study, a customized amplicon-based target sequencing panel was designed to enrich the whole exon regions of six genes associated with the risk of breast cancer. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed for 146 breast cancer patients (BC), 71 healthy women with a family history of breast cancer (high risk), and 55 healthy women without a family history of cancer (control). Sixteen possible disease-causing mutations on four genes were identified in 20 samples. The percentages of possible disease-causing mutation carriers in the BC group (8.9%) and in the high-risk group (8.5%) were higher than that in the control group (1.8%). The BRCA1 possible disease-causing mutation group had a higher prevalence in family history and triple-negative breast cancer, while the BRCA2 possible disease-causing mutation group was younger and more likely to develop axillary lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Among the 146 patients, 47 with a family history of breast cancer were also sequenced with another 14 moderate-risk genes. Three additional possible disease-causing mutations were found on PALB2, CHEK2, and PMS2 genes, respectively. The results demonstrate that the six-gene targeted NGS panel may provide an approach to assess the genetic risk of breast cancer and predict the clinical prognosis of breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "We report the case of a patient with a BRCA2 germline mutation who developed a localized pleomorphic soft tissue sarcoma of the leg with poor prognostic features. BRCA2 germline mutations were not previously reported to be associated with pleomorphic sarcoma. BRCA2 loss-of-heterozygosity was found in the tumor, resulting in a complete BRCA2 loss-of-function. BRCA2 deficiency is associated with sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in breast and ovarian cancer patients. We used a cisplatin-based chemotherapy. A rapid major partial response was obtained, which allowed a curative and conservative surgical resection of the sarcoma followed by adjuvant irradiation. This case illustrates that sarcoma patients may present unexpected but targetable genetic abnormalities and that BRCA2 loss-of-function may be targetable in sarcoma as it is associated with enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin. Our observation emphasizes the input of genomic medicine in clinical practice, its importance for treatment decisions, and the overlap between constitutional and somatic genetics.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Approximately 9% of pancreatic cancers harbor a germline or somatic BRCA1 orBRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation. Because poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors have significant activity inBRCA1/2-mutant ovarian and breast cancers, RUCAPANC investigated the efficacy and safety of rucaparib inBRCA1/2-mutant pancreatic cancer.                 RUCAPANC enrolled patients with measurable locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer who had received one to two prior chemotherapy regimens. Patients received oral rucaparib (600 mg twice daily) until disease progression. The primary end point was objective response rate.                 Nineteen patients were enrolled. Sixteen of 19 BRCA1/2 mutations were germ-line; three were somatic. Patients had received a median of two prior chemotherapy regimens. Four patients achieved a response; two partial responses and one complete response (CR) were confirmed (objective response rate, 15.8%; 3 of 19), with an additional CR unconfirmed. The disease control rate (CR, partial response, or stable disease for ≥ 12 weeks) was 31.6% (6 of 19) in all patients and 44.4% (4 of 9) in those who had received one prior chemotherapy regimen. As prespecified in the protocol, enrollment was stopped because of an insufficient response rate among the first 15 patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events included nausea (63.2%) and anemia (47.4%). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included anemia (31.6%), fatigue (15.8%), and ascites (15.8%). Secondary resistance mutations were detected in circulating free tumor DNA in two patients with a germlineBRCA2 mutation. These mutations are predicted to lead to the reversion of a somatic-not germline-mutation.                 Rucaparib provided clinical benefit to patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation, and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Additional trials of rucaparib in this population are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide variation of BRCA mutations is well known. The c.68_69delAG, c.181T>G, c.798_799delTT mutations in BRCA1 were observed in Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian Breast Cancer families and were described founder mutation in Northern Africa. The 943ins10 is also recognized a founder mutation in West Africa. To our knowledge no study has been published on BRCA1/2 germline mutations and hereditary breast cancer (HBC) in population of Burkina Faso. The aim of the present study (first in Burkina Faso) was to screen for these four mutations in 15 unrelated patients with HBC. Mutation analysis was performed by Sanger sequencing of coding exon2, Exon5 and exon11A sequences of the BRCA1 gene. Blood specimens of 15 patients from Burkina Faso, with HBC were collected at the University Hospital Yalgado OUEDRAOGO (CHU-YO) of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. c.68_69delAG (exon2), c.181T>G (exon5), c.798_799delTT and 943ins10 (exon11) mutations were not detected in any of the 15 women diagnosed with family breast cancer history. Genetic analysis in this study, we show that targeting relevant exons in BRCA1 genes did not allow detection of mutations in the population of Burkina Faso. Therefore, such an approach may be of interest to perfom a complete sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in families at a high risk of developing breast cancer in Burkina Faso.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent tumor entity in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Up to 80% of individuals with a Li-Fraumeni-like phenotype do not harbor detectable causative germline TP53 variants. Yet, no systematic panel analyses for a wide range of cancer predisposition genes have been conducted on cohorts of women with breast cancer fulfilling Li-Fraumeni(-like) clinical diagnostic criteria.                 To specifically help explain the diagnostic gap of TP53 wild-type Li-Fraumeni(-like) breast cancer cases, we performed array-based CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) and panel-based sequencing of 94 cancer predisposition genes on 83 breast cancer patients suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome who had previously had negative test results for causative BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 germline variants.                 We identified 13 pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in ten patients and in nine genes, including four copy number aberrations and nine single-nucleotide variants or small indels. Three patients presented as double-mutation carriers involving two different genes each. In five patients (5 of 83; 6% of cohort), we detected causative pathogenic variants in established hereditary breast cancer susceptibility genes (i.e., PALB2, CHEK2, ATM). Five further patients (5 of 83; 6% of cohort) were found to harbor pathogenic variants in genes lacking a firm association with breast cancer susceptibility to date (i.e., Fanconi pathway genes, RECQ family genes, CDKN2A/p14ARF, and RUNX1).                 Our study details the mutational spectrum in breast cancer patients suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome and indicates the need for intensified research on monoallelic variants in Fanconi pathway and RECQ family genes. Notably, this study further reveals a large portion of still unexplained Li-Fraumeni(-like) cases, warranting comprehensive investigation of recently described candidate genes as well as noncoding regions of the TP53 gene in patients with Li-Fraumeni(-like) syndrome lacking TP53 variants in coding regions.",
